S-188	The Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs found the number had gone up by 200 million since 2013 . There has been a big problem with plastic carrier bags in the last few years , many of them can &apos;t be recycled and are often thrown away after they have been used . The bags end up in rubbish dumps and even rivers causing big problems for the environment . From October people in England will have to pay 5p for their plastic bags in a bid to encourage them to re@@ use the ones that they already have . Super@@ markets in Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland , where people are charged for carrier bags , have all seen a decrease in bags used . Campaigners are hoping the charge in England will lessen the amount of bags being thrown away , helping the environment .

S-470	David Lip@@ ton , second in command at the IMF , outlined some of these risks in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Washington on Tuesday . &quot; The IMF &apos;s latest reading of the global economy shows once again a weakening baseline , &quot; he said . &quot; We are clearly at a delicate junc@@ ture . &quot; The comments come after weak@@ er-than-expected trade figures from China showing that exports plunged by a quarter from a year ago . The IMF has already said it is likely it will downgrade its current forecast of 3.4 % for global growth when it next releases its economic predictions in April . The dismal picture is one that has on-going ramifications for businesses and industries that bet on China &apos;s growth story .

All three feet have been found within a few hundred yards of each other . Tests showed the first foot found in Weston Park East in February was &quot; probably &quot; a medical teaching aid . The second foot , found last month in the same area , is still undergoing tests . &quot; The same officers are looking into the latest discoveries and will look to confirm beyond all reasonable doubt that they are linked and if there are any new lines of inquiry which can be taken forward , &quot; the spokesman added .

S-319	Acting Taoiseach Enda Kenny of Fine Gael and Mic@@ he@@ ál Martin of Fianna Fáil hope to avoid a second election . Mr Martin has said his party will facilitate a minority government , but will not support a programme for government . Water charges are one of the main sticking points to reaching agreement . A commission to consider the future of national water utility Irish Water is one of the proposals being considered . Fianna Fáil want to see the immediate removal of water charges , but Fine Gael see a role for them . Following the election , almost two months ago , Fine Gael had 50 seats , Fianna Fáil 44 , Sinn Féin 23 and the Labour Party got seven .

S-314	Nationalist MPs will take control of the UK Parliament &apos;s energy and climate change select committee and Scottish affairs select committee . The SNP won 56 of the 59 Westminster constituencies at the general election two weeks ago . That resulted in the party being the third largest , behind the Conservatives and Labour . Parliamentary convention dictates that the official third largest party at Westminster gets to chair a number of select committees . SNP chief whip Mike Weir said both committees were especially important to Scotland in this parliament . He said : &quot; We will be seeing one of the major bills coming forward in the Scotland Bill on more powers for Scotland , and of course the energy and climate change committee is of particular importance with our oil and gas sector and renewables industry . &quot; The SNP chairing these committees will allow us to make progress on these important issues , and will help us get the best deal for Scotland . &quot;

Back@@ ers , including Blaenau Gwent council , have offered around 320 hectares ( 800 acres ) replacement land . The inquiry has heard conflicting accounts from experts over claims the circuit would damage habitats and plant life by building on the common land . Natural Resources Wales said it was &quot; difficult to conclude &quot; that the replacement land was of equal value , but it was not opposing the development overall . But an ecology report presented by the developers said there would be a &quot; net gain &quot; in biodiversity because the plans included work to enhance other habitats nearby - which the Gwent wildlife trust argued against . The Planning Inspectorate for Wales will make a recommendation after the inquiry in Ebbw vale , before Welsh government ministers have the final say on whether the plans can go ahead .

S-228	UK-based Chatham House says more needs to be done to protect key transport routes such as the Panama Canal , the Suez Canal and the Turkish Straits . Almost 25 % of the world &apos;s food is traded on international markets . This , the report says , makes food supply and prices vulnerable to unforeseen crises or climate change . Infrastructure at the ch@@ ok@@ ep@@ oin@@ ts is often old and would struggle to cope with natural disasters which are expected to grow in frequency as the planet warms , the report authors add . They urge governments to invest in &quot; climat@@ e-@@ resilient &quot; infrastructure , and diversify food production and stocks . The report gives examples of how reliant the world is on this trade : &quot; The risks are growing as we all trade more with each other and as climate change takes hold , &quot; says Laura Well@@ esley , one of the study &apos;s authors . There are risks for both the food security of importing countries and the economies of those exporting food , she added .

But Unite regional officer Steve Harley said : &quot; We had productive talks and we were given guarantees that all current agreements will be honoured . &quot; Unite said it understood that the Bernard Matthews final salary pension scheme was closed in 2004 and that its members presently have an alternative pension scheme which is unaffected the takeover . The B@@ opar@@ an Private Office , the &quot; chicken king &quot; Mr B@@ opar@@ an &apos;s private investment , confirmed that the current pension arrangements with Bernard Matthews would continue under the new ownership . Mr Harley met with representatives from B@@ opar@@ an at the Great W@@ itch@@ ingham headquarters . He said : &quot; It was made clear that the new owner wishes to restore Bernard Matthews to its former position as a highly profitable business . &quot; This would be achieved by greater investment in the business , cost savings and util@@ ising the present spare capacity at Bernard Matthews to process chicken and not just tur@@ keys . &quot;

The report also found a record high percentage of black characters on broadcast television , thanks mostly to shows like Empire , Luke Cage and How to Get Away with Murder .

S-330	Sant@@ ner , 24 , broke his finger in only his second game for the county in 2016 . &quot; There is some unfinished business with Mitch , &quot; director of cricket Steve Rhodes told Worcestershire &apos;s website . &quot; Last summer he was very unlucky . Losing Mitch was a massive blow to our hopes of qualifying . We &apos;d had a good start and him playing all those games would have been an extra bonus for us . &quot; The left-arm batsman and spinner , who made his Test debut in 2015 , will rejoin the Rap@@ ids following June &apos;s ICC Trophy in England . Sant@@ ner added : &quot; I really enjoyed my time at Worcester with a great bunch of lads and it was so frustrating for me to pick up that injury in the very first T20 game . &quot; It &apos;s fantastic that I &apos;ve got the chance to come back again next summer and hopefully I can make up for lost time and make an impact with bat and ball . &quot; In August , Worcestershire signed Australia pace bowler John Hastings as their main overseas player for the 2017 season across all formats of the game .

S-370	David Mackintosh , Conservative MP for Northampton South , announced his decision ahead of a local party meeting where his candidacy was expected to be opposed . The BBC reported millions of pounds of public money loaned to Northampton Town FC appeared to have vanished . The MP has denied any wrongdoing . Mr Mackintosh was criticised over the loan to Northampton Town Football Club from the borough council - when he was leader - to rebuild Sixfields stadium and develop nearby land . About £ 10.@@ 25m of that money is now missing and the loan is subject to a police investigation into &quot; alleged financial irregularities . &quot; The football stand remains half built . When contacted by the BBC last week , a majority of his party &apos;s local executive council said they would vote to des@@ elect him . Mr Mackintosh had previously said he intended to stand for re-election . But in a statement , he said : &quot; It has been a huge honour to be the member of Parliament since 2015 , but I now feel it is the right time for my constituents to have a new representative . &quot;

S-172	Thomas Baker , known as Tommy , was found badly injured at Stanley Meat Market in the Old Swan area of Liverpool on 27 January . The 44-year-old , from Everton , had been shot in the head and chest . He died later in hospital . The three Liverpool men arrested - two aged 29 and the other 32 - remain in police custody for questioning . Merseyside Police said Mr Baker had left Phoenix Gym at the market shortly before he was shot while getting into his car . Detectives believe those involved in the shooting had been waiting outside the gym for about an hour . Det Ch Insp Bev Hyland said officers were still searching for a silver VW polo , which &quot; left the scene at speed &quot; and travelled along a number of roads including Balmoral Road , Molyneux Road and Queens Road . She added that a number of people captured on CCTV near the meat market had yet to come forward and while &quot; they may not think what they saw would be of any significance , they could have information which is key to our inquiries . &quot;

S-453	The Cherries went down 2-1 at Sunderland on Saturday , becoming the first team to lose to the Black Cats in the Premier League this season . Dan Gosling &apos;s goal , which gave them the lead , was their first for three games . &quot; It shouldn &apos;t be down to a lack of confidence , &quot; Howe told BBC Radio Solent . &quot; We scored six goals against Hull prior to these two games . &quot; He continued : &quot; A couple of weeks later , if you were to put the chances we &apos;ve created together into a clip sequence , the fact that we haven &apos;t even scored one goal is difficult to take . &quot; Bournemouth were stunned by goals for Sunderland from Victor Anichebe and a Jermain Defoe penalty and they were unable to find an equaliser , even against 10 men following Steven Pienaar &apos;s dismissal . &quot; We &apos;ve had enough chances to win three games today , &quot; Howe added . &quot; Sometimes football pans out that way and you have to accept it . It &apos;s how you move on from that which is key . &quot;

The sports college closed in August , while Skel@@ mer@@ sdale College &apos;s West@@ bank campus , owned by Newcastle College , is also unused . The decision follows a comparative study by Network Rail of both sites and one near the Con@@ course shopping centre . Skel@@ mer@@ sdale &apos;s original railway station closed to passengers in 1956 . The council - which owns Glen@@ burn Sports College - said Skel@@ mer@@ sdale could get two direct trains to Liverpool per hour under the plans it has made in partnership with Mersey@@ travel and West Lancashire Borough Council . County councillor John F@@ ill@@ is , cabinet member for highways and transport , said it was an &quot; exciting step forward . &quot; He said the preferred location was big enough to allow for the possibility of future expansion . He added : &quot; It has good highway access and good connectivity to the town and the surrounding area . &quot; The authority confirmed it will now start the process of acquiring the relevant land . Skel@@ mer@@ sdale was designated a new town on 9 October 1961 .. It is one of the largest towns in the north west of England not to have its own railway station .

S-92	The stone got past the elephant &apos;s fence and a ditch separating the animal and visitors , the zoo said in a statement . The girl was taken to hospital and died within a few hours , the zoo added . The zoo statement said the enclosure met international standards and said &quot; this kind of accident is rare , unpredictable and unusual . &quot; Africa Live : More on this and other stories The statement went on ( in French ) to point out two other recent incidents in the US : Ph@@ yl@@ lis Lee , Scientific Director of the Am@@ bos@@ eli Trust for Elephants , says that targeted throwing of stones and branches by elephants is very unusual . &quot; It can happen when elephants are frustrated or bored . In my opinion , it &apos;s unlikely the elephant was directly targeting the girl - but exhi@@ biting frustration . You can &apos;t predict what animals in captivity will do . &quot; The moments after the girl was struck at Rabat Zoo on Tuesday were filmed by a bystander and uploaded onto YouTube . The video shows the elephant waving its trunk behind a fence and swer@@ ves round to show a stone on the ground . Met@@ res away people are gathered around the girl , holding her head and stro@@ king her leg .

S-104	Officials believe Lawrence Phillips , 40 , killed himself early on Wednesday . In the 1990s , he was a star player at the University of Nebraska , making him a sought-after rookie in the NFL . Phillips played for the St Louis Rams , Miami Dol@@ phins and San Francisco 49@@ ers until 1999 , but he was plagued by trouble on and off the field . After his NFL career , Phillips continued to have problems with the law . Eventually , he was sent to prison after being convicted of assault for driving his car into a group of teenagers . In another case , he was convicted of assaulting a former girlfriend . Phillips , who was serving a term of more than 30 years , had been placed in a cell alone after he was accused of killing his former cell@@ mate . On Tuesday , a judge found that there was enough evidence to try Phillips in the death of Dam@@ ion Sow@@ ard , 37 . It is unclear how he took his own life . &quot; He was an intelligent person and had some good qualities , &quot; Tom Osborne , his coach at Nebraska , told the Associated Press news agency . &quot; Yet he had some anger issues and couldn &apos;t overcome the demons in his life . &quot;

S-155	Oxford City Council said the money had mostly been used for &quot; ground investigations of possible sites &quot; but nowhere suitable had been found . Two cemeteries still have space , in Wolver@@ cote and Bot@@ ley , but they are expected to be full by 2018 and 2021 . The council said it had not given up and was &quot; still exploring options . &quot; Linda Smith , board member for leisure , parks and sport , said the council has been &quot; searching for a suitable new burial site for many years . &quot; She added : &quot; But ultimately , as with new housing sites , we have run out of suitable land within Oxford . &quot; So far all the council-@@ owned sites that we have identified have , following ground investigations and surveys , had to be discounted . &quot; Either due to the size of the site , the ground conditions , a high water table or a cov@@ enant restricting the use of the site . &quot; After the two remaining cemeteries are full the council said only the reopening of family plots , the use of a few reserved plots , and the inter@@ ment of ashes would be possible . The last increase in burial space in Oxford was in 1932 .

S-374	Administrators of the A@@ CT test took the decision just hours before some 5,500 students were due to sit it . The A@@ CT is one of two entrance exams available to international and domestic students wanting to go to a US college . This is not the first cheating scandal to hit the tests in East Asia . The other entrance exam - the S@@ AT - was cancelled in South Korea in 2013 because some of the questions were leaked . The A@@ CT test was due to be held at 56 test centres in both South Korea and Hong Kong on Saturday morning . The Associated Press said teachers at some of Seoul &apos;s private &quot; c@@ ram schools &quot; said they were not notified until about an hour before the students were due to sit the test . A@@ CT Inc , an I@@ ow@@ a-based non-profit organisation that was operating the test , said it took the decision after receiving &quot; credible evidence that test materials intended for administration in these regions have been compromised . &quot; The organisation said in a statement that all students would get a refund but would only be able to re@@ sit when the tests are held again in September .

S-487	Landlords who let properties to more than three unrelated people need to apply for a licence for a House of Multiple Occupation ( HM@@ O ) . But many are put off - because a licence can cost ? ? 1,000 - despite facing a fine of up to ? ? 20,000 , Southampton City Council said . The authority estimated a total of 1,500 unlicensed HM@@ Os in the area . Shelter helpline adviser Nad@@ eem Khan said fear of eviction and living in poorly maintained properties are frequent concerns raised by HM@@ O tenants . &quot; Because of the huge shortage of affordable homes people are being forced into rented homes which are unregulated . We receive about five or six calls a day about this , &quot; he said . Nationally , mandatory licensing for HM@@ Os is aimed at houses of three storeys or more and occupied by five or more unrelated people . In Southampton , the licences affect properties in Bar@@ gate , Bev@@ ois , Port@@ swood , Sw@@ ay@@ th@@ ling ( Des@@ ig@@ nation 1 - introduced in 2013 ) and in Shirley Fre@@ eman@@ tle , Mill@@ brook , and Bassett ( Des@@ ig@@ nation 2 - introduced in 2015 ) . A council spokesman said : &quot; Landlords have generally co-operated with the regime , but a small minority have resisted applying for their licence . &quot; The council said it had so far gained prosecutions against one firm and 13 individuals .

Jamie Mitchell , 35 , of Apple Close , had admitted intervening in an argument between Mr Dickie and his mother . He shouted &quot; yes &quot; and was visibly shaking after the verdict was announced by a jury at Winchester Crown Court . The trial heard Mrs Mitchell and Mr Dickie had been in a relationship for several years and were going through a &quot; down phase &quot; when Mr Mitchell visited his mother at the park on 7 May . In the evening , Mr Mitchell accompanied his mother and Mr Dickie to the holiday park bar and got &quot; tan@@ ked up &quot; on alcohol . The two men had a confrontation outside and were separated by members of the public . Mr Mitchell had pleaded guilty to common assault in relation to the fight . He and his mother Samantha , 57 , also of Apple Close , also admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice by lying about the course of events . The court heard the pair had initially told police that Mr Dickie had pushed Mrs Mitchell and she had pushed him back . But Mr Mitchell later told police that he had tried to push the couple apart , causing what he described as a &quot; tragic accident . &quot; The pair will be sentenced on 6 February .

S-431	Police in Arkansas wish to unlock an iPhone and iP@@ od belonging to two teenagers accused of killing a couple , according to the Associated Press ( AP ) . Less than a day after its San Bernardino announcement , the FBI agreed to help in the homicide case . Syed Farook and his wife were shot dead after killing 14 people in December . A judge agreed to postpone the Arkansas case on 28 March to allow prosecutors to ask the FBI for help . Hunter Dre@@ xler , 18 , and Justin Stat@@ on , 15 , are accused of killing Robert and Patricia Cog@@ dell at their home in Conway , Arkansas last July . Stat@@ on had been raised as a grandson by the Cog@@ d@@ ells . &quot; We always appreciate &#91; the FBI &apos;s &#93; cooperation and willingness to help their local law enforcement partners , &quot; Faulkner County prosecuting attorney Cody Hil@@ land told the AP . An attorney for Mr Dre@@ xler told the AP he was &quot; not concerned &quot; about any data on the phone . Previously , the FBI had asked Apple to write new software that would allow it to gain access to Farook &apos;s iPhone . However , the company refused , arguing it would be wrong to compromise the security of one of its devices since that might lead to vulnerabilities in many other iPhones .

S-280	Mr Hockey &apos;s appointment comes after he left politics following his removal as treasurer by Malcolm Turnbull . He had been seen as a close ally of Tony Abbott who was ousted as PM by Mr Turnbull in a party vote in September . Mr Turnbull said Mr Hockey was &quot; a great Australian , he is one of the most engaging , persuasive people I &apos;ve known in public life . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s held very high office , he &apos;s got great contacts in the United States , he &apos;s a passionate patriot , &quot; he told Australian media . Announcing the appointment , Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Australia &apos;s relationship with the United States was the &quot; bedrock of foreign and defence policy . &quot; Some in the Labor opposition questioned the move , citing Mr Turnbull &apos;s role in ousting Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey &apos;s departure from politics . &quot; This is a very important posting for Australia and should be done by someone with a deep interest for foreign affairs , &quot; said deputy opposition leader Tanya P@@ liber@@ se@@ k . &quot; There is no doubt this is a captain &apos;s pick by Malcolm Turnbull , &quot; she told ABC television . Kim Bea@@ z@@ ley , who has has been Australia &apos;s ambassador to the United States since 2010 , will be replaced by Mr Hockey in January .

S-417	Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval . The move will bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales , where plans for automatic pardons were announced last month . Those proposals would see men convicted of now-@@ abolished sexual offences receive posthumous pardons . Dubbed &apos; Turing &apos;s Law &apos; , after the World War Two code-@@ breaker Alan Turing , the law will also allow living men convicted of such offences to apply for a pardon . The motion in the assembly is expected to contain the same provisions and allow for pardons both posthumously as well as for living gay and bisexual men . The minister said she has secured executive agreement to ask the assembly to pass a legislative consent motion to pardon convictions related to abolished sexual offences . Ms Sugden said that arrangements would be brought in &quot; as soon as possible to ensure that there is equal treatment for gay and bisexual men here as for their counterparts in England and Wales . &quot; &quot; This is an opportunity for the criminal justice system to try and right the wrongs of the past and one which will allow for much earlier resolve than that presented by way of an assembly bill , &quot; she added . The motion will now go forward for consideration by the assembly .

S-349	Vincent Barker , known as Vin@@ nie , died in July 2012 , five months after he had a routine eye test at Boots in Ipswich . The prosecution told Ipswich Crown Court the conduct of eye specialist Honey Rose , 35 , was so far below the expected standard it was &quot; criminal . &quot; Ms Rose denies a charge of gross negligence manslaughter . Read more on this story and other news from Suffolk Jonathan Rees QC said the alleged failure of Ms Rose , of Newham , east London , to detect Vin@@ nie &apos;s swollen optic discs during the routine test , and refer him on for further investigation , was &quot; at the heart of the prosecution case . &quot; A build-up of fluid in his brain increased pressure in Vin@@ nie &apos;s skull and ultimately led to his death , the court heard . &quot; The prosecution allege that Vin@@ nie &apos;s death was preventable and would have been prevented had the defendant , Ms Rose , done her job properly , &quot; he told the jury . &quot; Given the risk of death involved , her conduct was so bad in all of the circumstances - it fell so far below the standards to be expected of a competent op@@ t@@ ome@@ tr@@ ist - that it was criminal . &quot; The trial continues .

Council leader Dave Stewart said the crossing at Cowes would be free until 2 July &quot; in recognition of the problems &quot; and to allow feedback . Mr Stewart said the council had ordered a review of the project by auditors . He said it had been a &quot; frustrating and disappointing start &quot; to the ferry . Since launching late on 14 May the chain ferry has broken down , run aground and been suspended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency due to &quot; training issues . &quot; Cars have also been damaged getting on and off . Shop@@ keeper Angie Booth , who owns Val@@ u-@@ 4-@@ U in East Cowes , said : &quot; Whether I come out of this and survive I am not sure - other businesses too . We are bearing the brunt of the loss of almost six months of trade . &quot; Will you compensate local businesses , the same as for damaged cars ? &quot; Transport councillor Ian Ward said compensation was up for discussion . He added : &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a disaster . It &apos;s a prototype . There are bound to be teething problems . There were electrical problems which the company has rectified . &quot; He said the council authorised the manufacture of ramp extensions to resolve the problem of vehicles sc@@ raping the concrete . He said gr@@ oundings were an issue with sea@@ manship , which had been resolved .

S-472	Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said a new charter arrangement would end the long-running row over sea@@ far@@ ers &apos; pay . The RMT union had claimed some workers on board two freight boats were paid less than Â £ 4 an hour . The charter change will see contracted out services return to operator Serco North@@ link from next month . The freight vessels Hel@@ lier and Hil@@ da@@ say have been operated by Se@@ at@@ ruck , which is contracted to run the service by Serco North@@ link . Se@@ at@@ ruck argued the national minimum wage was not applicable to the crew , many of whom are non-UK residents . Serco North@@ link said it had repeatedly offered to bridge the pay gap and back@@ date it , but Se@@ at@@ ruck declined to accept . Mr Yousaf said the new arrangements would come into force early next month subject to some financial and regulatory details being finalised . He said : &quot; I &apos;m very pleased to see an agreement in principle now in place to end this long running issue around the freight vessels serving the Northern Isles . &quot; The new charter basis will allow the wage issue to be resolved . Going forward , I can confirm that all crew members will be paid at least the minimum wage . &quot; Serco North@@ link was awarded the six-year Â £ 24@@ 3m Northern Isles contract in 2012 . It operates three ferries and two cargo boats to the Northern Isles on a route which is heavily subsidised by the Scottish government .

S-12	Sidwell , 34 , has made 32 Championship appearances this season to help the Seagulls achieve promotion to the top flight for the first time in 34 years . With his contract due to expire at the end of the campaign , the midfielder is now hoping to sign a new deal . &quot; I want to be a part of it next year because I know we can stay in the Premier League , &quot; he said . Brighton &apos;s recent win over Wigan confirmed their promotion , and with a four-point lead over second-placed Newcastle , Chris Hughton &apos;s side are now hoping to wrap up the league title in the final two matches . Sidwell made 19 appearances for Albion on loan from Stoke during 2015-16 before signing a one-year deal with Brighton in June 2016 . He has previously played in the Premier League with Reading , Chelsea , Aston Villa , Fulham and Stoke and believes he deserves the opportunity to play at the top level again . Sidwell told BBC Radio Sussex : &quot; When I signed the contract last year no-one expected me to play as many games as I have . I &apos;ve probably given a better impact than expected . &quot; When I have played I &apos;ve played well , I &apos;ve put my best foot forward and I &apos;ve given myself every opportunity to earn a new deal . &quot; If there &apos;s one on the table then hopefully we can thrash it out , it can be done and we can enjoy the summer . &quot;

S-211	Chelmsford Prison told residents there had recently been &quot; numerous incidents &quot; of packages being hurled over the wall . One former inmate said the jail was &quot; notorious &quot; for being &quot; flooded &quot; with mobile phones and synthetic cannabis . The Ministry of Justice said staff worked &quot; extremely hard &quot; to stop contraband from getting into prisons . &quot; However more must be done , which is why the Justice Secretary has asked us to look at how we can ensure prisons have the tools in place to tackle this kind of problem , &quot; the spokeswoman added . Follow updates on this story and other news from Essex A woman who lives near the prison , who did not want to be named , said she had witnessed packages being thrown over the wall &quot; four times in two weeks . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s getting quite bad at the minute . The prison wants us to come to an evening to talk about what to do if anything does get thrown over , &quot; she said . &quot; I don &apos;t feel frightened , but obviously it &apos;s not nice - I always lock the doors and everything . &quot; The former inmate claimed drones were used to fly contraband goods &quot; straight up to prison windows , &quot; but the Ministry of Justice said there was no evidence of drones coming into the Chelmsford site . The spokeswoman said laws had been introduced which mean people who smuggle packages over prison walls could be jailed for up to two years .

S-341	Their comments , she wrote , &quot; reminds me how big the world is and how many more decent people there are than not . &quot; The Harry Potter author previously tweeted that her &quot; personal line &#91; had &#93; been crossed &quot; by some abusive comments . &quot; It isn &apos;t always fun being a famous woman on Twitter and I believe in standing up to bullies , &quot; she wrote . Rowling faced a flood of criticism on Twitter last year after it emerged she had donated Â £ 1m to the campaign for a No vote in the Scottish independence referendum . In 2008 , she donated the same amount to the Labour party . On Friday the author revealed she had been called &quot; a traitor &quot; for her political views and had blocked some abusive Twitter users she believed had been supporters of the Scottish National Party ( SNP ) . &quot; I feel no responsibility to hus@@ h up that kind of behaviour to protect the image of any political party , &quot; she told one Twitter user . The 49-year-old also revealed she had &quot; responded to other really nice SNP supporters &quot; and had discussed &quot; how much I had in common politically with many of them . &quot; The writer also joked she would &quot; bring marsh@@ m@@ allows &quot; after a Twitter user suggested her books should be burned in public . The SNP took 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland in Thursday &apos;s election and is now the third largest party in the UK .

S-413	Mr Char@@ ney , who also founded the company , was ousted last year because of the employee complaints and amid accusations of misuse of company funds . In the San Francisco court filing , the board said it did not expect him ever to return to the firm . Mr Char@@ ney &apos;s lawyer said many of the statements made were false . &quot; The company has engaged in an invasion of Mr Char@@ ney &apos;s privacy in a shameful attempt to ext@@ ort him and gain leverage over him , &quot; said his lawyer Keith F@@ ink . The court filing documents evidence of illicit emails written to female employees by the former chief executive , as well as racially derogatory ta@@ unts . They come in response to Mr Char@@ ney &apos;s defamation lawsuit against the company and its chair . Mr Char@@ ney &quot; repeatedly engaged in conduct that violated the company &apos;s sexual harassment and anti-discrimination policy , &quot; the company &apos;s papers say . &quot; Given this set of facts ... it would be hard to find any board of any company ... that would be willing to hire Mr Char@@ ney as its CEO , executive , or employee . The risk to the company and its shareholders would just be too great , &quot; the board adds . Earlier this month , American Ap@@ pa@@ rel was granted a restraining order preventing him from making any negative statements in the press about the company and from trying to get board members removed .

The 27-year-old says he is close to a return , giving him time to get fit before the Six Nations in February . &quot; I &apos;m back up and running now and going through a pre-season sort of stage at the moment . It &apos;s all coming along well , &quot; he said . &quot; I &apos;m going to take each week as it comes now and see where I am then . &quot; It &apos;s been talked about &#91; returning &#93; at the beginning of February , but I did ask the physi@@ os if they could sc@@ rape a couple of weeks off that and they said &apos; yes &apos; . &quot; Wales begin their Six Nations campaign away to Ireland in Dublin on Sunday , 7 February . Webb , capped 16 times by Wales , has renewed his national dual contract with Ospreys and the Welsh Rugby Union . He turned down offers from elsewhere to stay at the region for whom he made his debut in 2007 . &quot; It &apos;s my home region and I enjoy the club , &quot; Webb told BBC Wales &apos; Scrum V Live . &quot; I want to put myself in the best possible position to play for my country and I &apos;m not going to give that up that easy . &quot; Wales and the Ospreys came together and I &apos;m happy to get it done . &quot;

S-152	St Bot@@ olph &apos;s Church , known as Boston St@@ ump , was badly damaged following a tidal surge in 2013 that hit the Lincolnshire town of Boston . The floodlights were replaced but the switch@@ -on was put in doubt when two lights were stolen . Reverend Aly@@ son Buxton said it was &quot; fantastic &quot; to see the church lit up . &quot; We &apos;ve all been so excited for this moment , &quot; she said . &quot; It &apos;s wonderful to see so many people here who &apos;ve had a wonderful service inside . There &apos;s at least 400 people here so it &apos;s absolutely fantastic . &quot; The lights were switched on by BBC Radio Lincolnshire presenters Carla George and Scott Dalton . Peter Sherlock , who gave the church Â £ 2,000 to re@@ install the stolen lights , was among those present and said the service was &quot; very moving . &quot; He is still offering a reward of Â £ 2,000 for information about who stole the lights . Matt War@@ man , the Boston and Skegness MP , was also there . &quot; A lot of Boston &apos;s heritage is about this building and it &apos;s hugely significant for everyone , &quot; he said . &quot; It &apos;s been a long time since the floods that turned these lights off and I think people are now finally starting to see that we are able to get past that and to show people that Boston is un@@ qu@@ enc@@ hable . &quot;

S-369	The Rhinos have been training across the city of Leeds since the river A@@ ire burst its banks at Christmas . Chief executive Gary Hetherington told BBC Radio Leeds : &quot; It is looking like £ 1m in total . It has caused massive disruption . &quot; But sport throws up all sorts of challenges and this is another one . &quot; All seven training pitches and the main building at the Kirk@@ stall site the Rhinos share with rugby union side Yorkshire Carnegie were contaminated by flood water at the end of December . The Rhinos , who begin the defence of their Super League title against Warrington on 4 February , say that 80 members of staff based at the site , plus 120 players , have been kept out for the last month . &quot; We couldn &apos;t get anywhere near the site , &quot; said Hetherington . &quot; When we were able to access it , the reality hit everybody . The whole site was under water . The changing rooms , medical rooms and gym@@ na@@ sium , and all the equipment was completely destroyed . &quot; All the pitches are contaminated so they need to be dug up and re@@ seeded . The 3G pitch needs to be replaced . The buildings need to be repl@@ ast@@ ered , all the floors need to come up . &quot; It will be the best part of six months before we can use the grass pitches and gym@@ na@@ sium . &quot;

O &apos;Donnell wrote on her blog that she searched &quot; women &apos;s heart attack symptoms , &quot; which included sudden nausea and aches , before taking a few aspir@@ in . She visited a cardi@@ ologist the next day , who inserted a st@@ ent into an artery that was 99 per cent blocked . O &apos;Donnell said her chest began to ache last week and she became naus@@ eous and fever@@ ish after helping a woman who was struggling to get out of her car in her Ny@@ ack village home , near New York . In the blog entry on her website , a poem entitled &quot; my heart attack , &quot; O &apos;Donnell revealed the type of attack was known as the &quot; widow maker . &quot; The star , who has acted in several films and TV shows including Dro@@ p Dead Di@@ va , Will and Grace and Ni@@ p / T@@ uck , also said she did not call the emergency services . However , she issued a warning to her readers : &quot; Know the symptoms ladies , listen to the voice inside , the one we all so easily ignore , call 911 . &quot; She recently hosted The Rosie Show on the Oprah Winfrey Network but the daily talk and gam@@ es@@ how was cancelled in March due to low ratings .

S-386	Seven firms , including major supermarkets such as N@@ TUC Fair@@ Price and I@@ K@@ EA , have been asked declare they are not doing so within a week . The forest fires in Indonesia have deteriorated Singapore &apos;s air quality , causing a blanket of haze in the city . Fair@@ Price has said it removing products from one Indonesian firm . The state-owned supermarket giant said that it was removing all paper products sourced from Asia Pul@@ p and Paper Group ( A@@ PP ) , following the notification from the government . A@@ PP has been named by Singapore authorities as one of the companies suspected of contributing to the haze . What is behind the South East Asia haze ? In a joint statement , the Singapore Environment Council ( SEC ) and Consumers Association of Singapore ( CA@@ SE ) said they had asked the retailers to declare that they have &quot; not pro@@ cured or used wood , paper and / or pul@@ p materials &quot; from firms accused of contributing to the fires . The SEC said retailers were &quot; a good starting point &quot; for firms to show their commitment to sustainable procurement processes and &quot; for consumers to show their support for brands that have environmentally friendly practices &quot; The haze has caused hazardous air quality across the region . It has led to the cancellation of public events and schools closure over the past month , in Singapore as well as in Malaysia and Indonesia . Anger has been rising in the region , with increasing pressure on the Indonesian government to control the annual burning of forests to clear land for palm oil and rubber plantations .

S-348	Uefa &apos;s executive will not allow their congress to discuss Jersey &apos;s bid as the island is not recognised by the United Nations as an independent nation . Representatives from Uefa visited the island , which is a crown dependency of Great Britain , in September to meet with Jersey football officials . &quot; This was the response we expected , &quot; said Jersey FA president Phil Austin . &quot; From a footballing perspective we more than meet the criteria . &quot; In rejecting our application , the executive of Uefa have said that they &apos;re not putting our application forward to the congress . We don &apos;t think the executive have the authority to do that , we think it should go to congress , &quot; Austin told BBC Sport . Jersey submitted a bid to leave the English FA and join Uefa in December 2015 , following the acceptance of Gibraltar and Kosovo , who are not independent nations . But Gibraltar &apos;s initial application in 2007 came before the rules were changed , while Kosovo , who joined Uefa in May and played in their first World Cup qualifier in September declared independence from Serbia in 2008 . &quot; I have no idea how long it &apos;s going to take , we are waiting for a court date hopefully within the next six months , but I don &apos;t know , &quot; added Austin . &quot; We are watching the costs very carefully and we will take it each step at a time and managed our budget accordingly . &quot; One or two people have stepped forward who believe in what we &apos;re doing and will help us with our funding . &quot;

S-295	Josh Earnest said the closure of the Cuban detention camp was a national security interest . It was one of the first directives President Barack Obama ordered two months after he was elected in 2008 . In@@ mates have slowly been transferred out and at the start of the year , 122 men were left . The peak population in 2003 was 6@@ 84 . Mr Earnest said the administration was &quot; in the final stages of drafting a plan to safely and responsibly ( close ) the prison at Guantanamo Bay and to present that to Congress . &quot; He added : &quot; That has been something that our national security officials have been working on for quite some time , primarily because it is a priority of the president . &quot; In 2009 , President Obama admitted the January 2010 deadline he had set for closing the counter-terrorism facility would be missed . Since then , Congress bipartisan opposition has meant the transfer of prisoners to the US has been blocked . Some have been considered too dangerous to be released , but the US holds no evidence that can be used in civilian or military trials against them . The US has slowly been sending prisoners back to their home countries or to third countries , a process Mr Earnest said needs to continue if the facility is to shut . The camp was established in 2002 by the Bush administration to detain the most dangerous suspects for interrogation and the prosecution of war crimes . Contro@@ versy has centred around the period of time detainees have been held without charge and the use of interrogation techniques .

S-333	Opener Stuart Thompson hit 56 while Gary Wilson ( 41 no ) and captain William Porterfield ( 39 ) added valuable runs as Ireland made 16@@ 5-5 in Greater No@@ ida . It was not enough with Sam@@ i@@ ullah Shen@@ war@@ i ( 56 ) and Mohammad Shahzad ( 47 ) helping the Afghans to 17@@ 1-4 with two overs to spare . The sides meet again in the second T20 at the same venue on Friday . Ireland suffered an early blow when opener Paul Stirling was dismissed for a duck and with just one run on the board . Thompson and Porterfield steadied the innings before Wilson helped the Irish to a competitive total . Shahzad and Naj@@ eeb Tar@@ ak@@ ai ( 27 ) put on an opening stand of 51 as Afghanistan cruised to their victory target . Afghan spinner Amir Hamza ( 2-@@ 23 ) was the only bowler to take more than one wicket on a day when the bat dominated . &quot; We fell a little bit short of potentially a very big score . We could have added another 15 and gotten up to the 180 we were looking for , &quot; said Porterfield . &quot; As well as we played I thought we just came up short with the ball . We didn &apos;t quite execute things as well as we would have liked . &quot; The loss of paceman Boyd Rankin for the T20s , because of a back problem , was another setback for the Irish on Wednesday . Rankin is expected to return for the five ODIs against Afghanistan , starting on 15 March .

S-263	Ryan Walls took pictures of 101 passengers during the Edinburgh Festival in 2015 . The 42-year-old said only two people refused out of the 103 people he asked due to being in a hurry and having a bad hair day . Now the father-of-three &apos;s pictures will go on display at Out of the Blue Dr@@ ill Hall , Dal@@ men@@ y Street , in August . Mr Walls told the BBC Scotland news website how he took photographs of a hen party , stag do , football fans , a chef , a high court judge and a TV agony aunt from Kuwait . He said : &quot; Everyone was so nice . One of the pictures is of a passenger who was in such a hurry that he couldn &apos;t wait for another taxi when I discovered the central locking system was broken so I had to pull him in and out of the taxi window . &quot; I also had an elderly former English teacher who had suddenly decided she wanted to go out to a show at the festival at the last minute and she had lots of words of encouragement for me so I really enjoyed chatting with her . &quot; I also got a Jam@@ bo fan and was worried I wasn &apos;t going to get a Hibs fan but luckily I did . &quot; I &apos;m really interested in people and wanted to capture that moment in my cab , I only had seconds to take a few pictures and I &apos;m really pleased with the end result . &quot; The exhibition runs from 31 July until 5 August .

S-495	An area of the town near the swimming pool had been evacuated for most of the morning and early afternoon . Other residents close by had been advised to open windows , stay indoors near walls and to avoid going outside . An exclusion zone remains in force on the river while experts make safe the sea mine which was spotted on Monday . It is thought to be a British mine , dating from the 1940s or 1950s . The evacuation affected three streets , with wider safety advice issued to residents within 500m of the device . There was also an exclusion zone at sea of about half a mile , and small boat owners were told not to sail during the operation . Caledonian MacBrayne reported some disruption to ferry services , affecting sailings from Gou@@ rock and Ro@@ thes@@ ay . Ch Insp Elliot Brown , the local area commander for Inverclyde , stressed that the evacuation had been a precautionary measure , and that there was no immediate danger to the community of Gou@@ rock . Lt Cdr Tim Ca@@ str@@ in@@ oy@@ ann@@ akis , the officer in charge of the Royal Navy &apos;s Northern Diving Unit , said that due to the deterioration of the mine it was not possible to conclude how much explosive material it still contained . He said that because of this it was decided to move it to a safer place before dealing with it . Inverclyde Council said : &quot; Thanks to residents and businesses in Gou@@ rock for their patience while the cordon and safe evacuation procedures were carried out today . &quot;

S-271	Wellington monument on the Black@@ down Hills , in Somerset , was built in 18@@ 17 but since 2005 it has been fenced off because of falling stone debris . The National Trust is using ground-@@ penetrating radar on the 17@@ 4ft ( 53m ) tower to see under its stone cladding . Ken Evans , from the trust , said the work was &quot; crucial . &quot; Built on one of the highest points of the Black@@ down Hills , the landmark was put up as a tribute to the Duke of Wellington &apos;s military achievements at the Battle of Waterloo . But according to the trust , it has been struck by lightning twice in its history and renov@@ ating the very tall landmark every 10 to 15 years has been &quot; expensive and unsustainable . &quot; Mr Evans , the trust &apos;s building surveyor , said the radar study was one of several being carried out to &quot; understand this unique and somewhat complex monument . &quot; &quot; We have been using wind and movement sensors which have already surprised us by showing that it doesn &apos;t flex in the wind quite as much as we expected , &quot; he said . &quot; The ground-@@ penetrating radar seeks to identify vo@@ ids and gaps in the st@@ one@@ work under the surface but should also tell us more about the materials which were used to build the ob@@ el@@ is@@ k . &quot; Data from the detailed survey will also be used to build a computer model of the ob@@ el@@ is@@ k and help with a &quot; more effective repair approach . &quot;

S-169	The Asian Civ@@ ilisation Museum ( AC@@ M ) bought the artwork for $ 650,000 ( £ 4@@ 20,000 ) from New York dealer Art of the Past in 2007 . The company &apos;s manager later admitted selling stolen Indian antiquities , including the bronze being returned . The allegations first came to light during a 2012 court case against the firm for trafficking antiquities . The sculpture of Hindu go@@ dd@@ ess U@@ ma Param@@ esh@@ var@@ i is thought to have been stolen from a Shi@@ va temple in Tamil Nadu in southern India . The decision to return the item came after discussions between Singapore &apos;s National Heritage Board and the Indian government body looking after its antiquities , the Archaeological Survey of India ( AS@@ I ) . The AS@@ I submitted an official request for the return of the sculpture in May , according to the museum . &quot; While there is no conclusive proof that the sculpture was stolen from a Shi@@ va temple in Tamil Nadu , India , AC@@ M took note of the confession of Aaron Freedman , who was the manager of Art of the Past , of dealing in looted Indian antiquities and of criminal possession of 150 stolen objects , &quot; the museum said in a statement . It was one of 30 objects AC@@ M bought from the art dealer , although none of the others are thought to be listed as stolen . The AS@@ I was reportedly allowed to view them , anyway . The museum said it will take legal action to get compensation for the apparent fraud .

S-189	The venture &apos;s backers include Tesla Motors and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , Pay@@ pal co-founder Peter Thiel , Indian tech giant In@@ fos@@ ys and Amazon Web Services . Open AI says it expects its research - free from financial obligations - to focus on a &quot; positive human impact . &quot; Scientists have warned that advances in AI could ultimately threaten humanity . Mr Musk recently told students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) that AI was humanity &apos;s &quot; biggest existential threat . &quot; Last year , British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking told the BBC AI could potentially &quot; re-@@ design itself at an ever increasing rate , &quot; super@@ se@@ ding humans by out@@ pacing biological evolution . However , other experts have argued that the risk of AI posing any threat to humans remains remote . A statement on Open@@ AI &apos;s website said the venture aims &quot; to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole , un@@ constrained by a need to generate financial return . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s hard to fath@@ om how much human-@@ level AI could benefit society , and it &apos;s equally hard to imagine how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly . &quot; The statement said AI &quot; should be an extension of individual human w@@ ills and , in the spirit of liberty , as broadly and evenly distributed as is possible safely . &quot; It said only a tiny fraction of the $ 1bn pledged would be spent in the next few years .

S-464	PC Keith Palmer &apos;s murder , in an attack outside the Houses of Parliament in March , prompted &quot; greater emphasis &quot; on the need for a permanent memorial . The UK Police Memorial Trust appealed for £ 1.5m towards its construction at the National Memorial Ar@@ boretum . It is set to bear the names of more than 1,400 officers and staff . Sir Hugh Or@@ de , chairman of the trust , said : &quot; PC Palmer &apos;s death has put greater emphasis on the need to create a place where the nation can honour and commemorate our police service and where family , friends and colleagues of those killed on duty can go to carry out personal acts of remembrance . &quot; We need to establish a fitting memorial that recognises the vital contribution that policing makes to our society and acknowledges the courage and sacrifice made by police officers and police staff who have paid the ultimate price . &quot; That tribute must become part of the fabric of our national life . &quot; More updates on this story The memorial , at the site in Al@@ re@@ was , Staffordshire , will be dedicated to the courage and sacrifice of the officers , who have lost their lives over the past 250 years . A brass screen will have leaf shapes cut out and given to the families of fallen officers , with the names of loved ones as a personal memorial . Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the government had committed £ 1m towards the £ 4m needed for it . &quot; It is entirely fitting that those officers and staff who give their lives in the line of duty should be remembered with a lasting tribute , &quot; she said . The memorial is expected to be completed by 2019 .

S-52	Andrew Travers left the authority by &quot; mutual agreement &quot; after the error , officials said . Voters were initially turned away from all 155 polling stations in the borough because their names were missing from the poll list . An independent investigation has been launched , the council said . In a statement issued through the council , Mr Travers said : &quot; I have enjoyed my time at Barnet and I believe the changes we have put in place and the continued programme of growth and transformation will enable the borough to continue to thrive . &quot; A council spokesperson said Mr Travers had &quot; made a valuable contribution to the council during his three and half years as chief executive . &quot; Deputy chief executive John H@@ oot@@ on will take over temporarily while longer term arrangements are put in place , the council said . On election day , staff at one station said just three of the first 30 voters to show up were on the register . The rest were told to come back later . Barnet Council apologised for the problems and later offered emergency proxy votes to residents who had been affected . But voters in the area questioned how the result could be &quot; fair &quot; when not everyone was able to have their say at the ballot box . A statement released by Mr Travers on Thursday blamed electoral registration lists for the problems . The council &apos;s review will conclude by the end of May and the findings will be presented publicly to the General F@@ unc@@ tions Committee . It will look at the &quot; appropri@@ at@@ eness &quot; of arrangements in place for the EU Referendum in June . A spokesman said it was currently in discussions to establish who would lead the investigation .

S-8	Monitor is looking into the financial sustainability of Southend University Hospital Foundation Trust &quot; on behalf of patients , &quot; the NHS regulator said . Fin@@ ances became a concern when a planned £ 7.@@ 8m deficit grew , for which Monitor could see no recovery plan . The hospital blamed the larg@@ er-than-@@ anticipated deficit on growth in demand and increased staff recruitment . Hospital chairman Alan Tobias OBE , said : &quot; The overspend is a result of vital investment in services and more staff to ensure high standards of patient care as well as the rise in attendances . &quot; We welcome this review to clearly demonstrate to Monitor - as well as patients and stakeholders - our future financial plans are both robust and sustainable . &quot; The hospital has pledged to cut the deficit while maintaining &quot; high quality care for local people &quot; and said it was committed to returning to a surplus within three years . Monitor said its investigation will look into the state of the hospital trust &apos;s finances , assess the strength of its financial management and explore ways of improving its sustainability , on behalf of patients across the region . The investigation will also examine how the trust works with other local health and care organisations to respond to the financial challenges it faces . Katherine Caw@@ ley , regional director at Monitor , said : &quot; People are relying on Southend to provide them with quality healthcare now and in the future , and we are concerned that this may be at risk because of the trust &apos;s poor financial performance . &quot; We have launched this investigation to find out more about the financial situation at the trust and to establish what can be done to improve things . &quot;

S-408	Stephen Hammond said job roles would change when the paper system for car tax discs is scrapped in October . The minister all@@ ayed fears about job losses in a letter to Swansea East AM Mike Hedges . Mr Hedges said the minister &apos;s response would &quot; give comfort &quot; to DVLA employees . Concerns over the future of some of the 5,000 workers at the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency centre were raised in October after Chancellor George Osborne &apos;s Autumn Statement . The chancellor announced that the tax disc would be replaced with an electronic system in October 2014 . The new system will allow people to pay the charge by monthly direct debit . Mr Hedges had written to Mr Hammond asking for clarification of the government &apos;s intentions . In his response to Mr Hedges , Mr Hammond said : &quot; It is likely that the introduction of a direct debit scheme may mean there will be a natural reduction in the amount of refunds received , in addition to the withdrawal of the tax disc . &quot; This may mean changes to job roles and the need to train on new processes . &quot; Any reductions in numbers of people needed for these activities will be managed through re@@ deploying to other growth areas of the business . &quot; Mr Hedges welcomed the minister &apos;s assurances . He added : &quot; Whilst disappointed that the changes will reduce the number of job opportunities at the DVLA , I can see the advantages of both paying by monthly direct deb@@ its and not having to show a tax disc . &quot; I am pleased the minister is committed to re@@ deployment rather than redundancies and I am sure this response will give comfort to many concerned DVLA employees . &quot;

S-151	Timothy Ge@@ aney admitted taking or permitting the images to be taken between April 2004 and February 2014 . He was made the subject of a community payback order and put on the sex offenders register earlier this year . He has now been removed from his profession &apos;s register following a General Teaching Council Scotland hearing . In February , Dumfries Sheriff Court heard how most of the images he had downloaded were of young boys partially dressed in erotic poses with no sexual activity . In addition to his payback order he was ordered to take part in a special programme for sex offenders . A G@@ TC Scotland hearing was told that the nature of the offence meant Ge@@ aney had &quot; con@@ doned and participated in an industry that violates and abuses children . &quot; It heard that his conduct was &quot; fundamentally incompatible &quot; with being a registered teacher . The panel found that Ge@@ aney had failed to uphold the standards expected of the profession . It also noted that the offending behaviour had taken place over a lengthy period of time &quot; demonstrating that there was a pattern of behaviour , as opposed to an isolated incident . &quot; &quot; Given the volume of images and the duration of the conduct , taken with the lack of evidence of remedial action , the panel was of the view that there was a strong likelihood of the offending behaviour recurring , &quot; it concluded . The panel found him unfit to teach and removed him from the professional register . Ge@@ aney , who was 69 at the time he was sentenced , was not present at the hearing . He was prohibited from applying to re-@@ register for a period of two years .

S-38	The measure guarantees a majority of seats to the party that wins the most votes in an election . It is a key element of a package of reforms promised by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi . The law seeks to end Italy &apos;s post-war era of revol@@ ving governments , political horse-@@ trading and unstable coalitions . The lower house of parliament gave final approval to the bill by 3@@ 34 votes to 61 . The proportional election system awards 340 out of 6@@ 30 seats to any party that wins more than 40 % of the national vote . If no party reaches that threshold , there is a second-round run-off between the two parties with the most votes . The electoral reform is expected to come into force next year . After the vote , Mr Renzi said : &quot; Commit@@ ment achieved , promise respected . Italy needs people who don &apos;t always say no . &quot; Critics have accused the 40-year-old former mayor of Florence who became prime minster last year of trying to consolidate his grip on power . They complain that the law awards too much power to single parties , gives party bosses too much scope to select candidates , and denies voters the chance to directly choose representatives . Opposition parties boycotted Monday &apos;s vote . Renato Brun@@ etta , parliamentary head of centre-right opposition party For@@ za Italia , said afterwards that it was &quot; a very ugly day for our country &apos;s democracy . &quot; Mr Renzi wants to further transform the Italian system by abolishing the Senate and replacing it with a non-@@ elected body with lesser powers . Currently , legislation is often held up because identical versions of bills have to be approved by both houses .

S-347	Barca remain six points off leaders Real after Sergio Ramos &apos; last-minute header made it 1-1 after Luis Suarez had opened the scoring . &quot; In the second half , we were the better side , but we didn &apos;t manage to get the second goal and they ended up equalising , &quot; said Enrique . &quot; That said , we deserved to win . It is not the best result for us . &quot; Barca were poor in the first half but looked set to close the gap on unbeaten Real to three points before Ramos headed home Modric &apos;s free-kick . &quot; It was a very even first half and a second that we were better , we created chances . We continued looking for the second to avoid being levelled , but we were unable to do so , &quot; added Enrique . &quot; In my opinion , the performance of the team was higher than that of the rival , but we have to improve , it is clear . &quot; I say this even when we win , and even when we draw . We can improve in all aspects of the game . We are ambitious . &quot; Enrique was happy to see captain Andres Iniesta return from an injury that has kept him out for six weeks .

S-82	The Sor@@ ren@@ to was travelling to the coastal city of Valencia when the blaze began and quickly got out of control . The passengers were evacuated from the burning ship on to lifeboats and have been rescued by another ship . At least three people have been injured and have been taken to hospital by helicopter , Spanish media say . One is reported to be seriously hurt . The ship was about 27@@ km ( 17 miles ) from Mall@@ orca when the fire broke out on Tuesday afternoon on one of the car dec@@ ks . The reason for the fire was unclear . Several ships including two passenger ferries were sent to help . The passengers and crew on the life raf@@ ts eventually boarded one of the ferries , the Pu@@ gli@@ a . Spanish officials said the rescued passengers were on their way back to Pal@@ ma de Mall@@ orca and were expected to arrive at the port in a few hours &apos; time . Psych@@ ologists were being asked to go to the port to provide counselling . &quot; Due to the fire that it has suffered , The Sor@@ ren@@ to may sink in the position in which it finds itself , &quot; the Bal@@ ear@@ ic Islands port authority said in a tweet ( in Spanish ) . The ferry , owned by Italian company Atlan@@ tica di Nav@@ ig@@ az@@ i@@ one , sent out distress signals at 13 : 50 local time ( 11 : 50 GMT ) , said Spain &apos;s Ministry of Public Works . At first , the ministry said the captain did not believe it would be necessary to abandon the ship but the fire became so intense that a full evacuation was called for .

S-475	The &quot; black box &quot; of the Su-@@ 24 jet was officially opened in Moscow on Friday in front of journalists and diplomats . Nikol@@ ai Pri@@ ma@@ k , head of the Russian investigation , said flight information appeared to be missing . Data from the box could help resolve the dispute over the jet &apos;s location when it was hit . An analysis is expected to be released next week . The downing of the jet plunged relations between Russia and Turkey into crisis , with Moscow imposing sanctions in response . Turkey insists that the jet , from the Russian air contingent deployed in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad , ignored warnings to leave its airspace . Russia says it was shot down within Syrian airspace and President Vladimir Putin vented his anger at Turkey &apos;s government again on Thursday , accusing it of sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ence to the US and of &quot; creeping Islam@@ isation . &quot; What we know about how the Su-@@ 24 was downed How Russia &apos;s sanctions could hit Turkey The war of words as it erupted The two countries are heavily involved in Syria but take radically different positions despite both being ostensibly opposed to the Islamic State ( IS ) militant group . The Su-@@ 24 was shot down by F-@@ 16 fighters on 24 November . Both crew members ejected but the pilot was killed , apparently by militants on the ground while the navig@@ ator was rescued . A Russian marine sent to rescue the crew was also killed and a helicopter destroyed on the ground . Russia has demanded an apology from Turkey and in the meantime has imposed sanctions including a ban on package holidays , which could cost Turkey billions of dollars .

S-141	Head coach Warren Gatland is leading the British and Irish Lions in New Zealand and has named interim coach Rob Howley as part of his backroom team . Forwards coach McBryde assumes head coach responsibilities for the third time after leading Wales on tours in 2009 and 2013 . &quot; It is an honour to represent your country and to do so overseas carries extra responsibility , &quot; said McBryde . &quot; For me it is another exciting opportunity to lead the team . It is something I have thoroughly enjoyed in the past and I &apos;m really looking forward to doing it again at the end of the season . &quot; The Welsh Rugby Union ( WRU ) will appoint assistant coaches for the summer tour to assist McBryde . &quot; We are also at an advanced stage in discussions with a number of other individuals about the summer tour and hope to be in a position to confirm the full make-up of the management team next week , &quot; said WRU chief executive Martyn Phillips . Union chairman Gareth Davies , who is also on the Lions &apos; selection panel , believes the involvement of Welsh coaches will benefit the national team . &quot; 2017 is a real summer of opportunity for Welsh coaches and should benefit the whole of Welsh rugby in the years ahead , &quot; he said . &quot; It is not often that you get the opportunity to develop coaches in different environments . &quot; Our coaches and players have been inv@@ igor@@ ated by their Lions experiences on previous campaigns and there is little doubt that a tour of New Zealand will provide the ultimate test and so once again both mentally stimulate and inspire each individual . &quot;

S-118	The Queen &apos;s Park Rangers player made his NI debut in March and scored in his second game against Slovenia . Washington , a postman just four years ago , followed that up with another goal against Belarus on Saturday . &quot; The last few months have been a crazy time and I don &apos;t think it has sunk in yet . I know I have been fortunate , &quot; said the 24-year-old . &quot; Football can be about being in the right place at the right time , and I have been lucky . &quot; Maybe in a couple of years I will look back and realise how mad it has all been . &quot; Washington combined representing non-@@ League St Ives between 2010 and 2012 with a job delivering mail . Having averaged more than a goal-@@ a-@@ game in his 50 appearances for a club in the ninth tier , he then got his break with Newport who paid £ 5,000 for him . The Welsh club were promoted to the Football League in his first season , although Washington barely featured . He then moved to Peterborough in 2014 and by mid-@@ January of this year , when QPR took him from London Road , Washington had scored 15 goals and ar@@ oused the interest of Northern Ireland manager Michael O &apos;Neill . Washington had only been to the country once before his international bow against Wales in March but he qualified through the grand@@ parent rule . &quot; It was nice to be accepted so quickly and so readily with Northern Ireland , &quot; he added . &quot; Life doesn &apos;t get much better . I &apos;m proud of my achievements and just have to try to enjoy it . &quot;

S-125	The law also permits 12-@@ year-olds to be contracted to work for others . But they need parental authorisation . Vice-President Alvaro Garcia Lin@@ era said the new legislation reflects the needs of Bolivia , one of the poorest countries in South America . It also sets harsher punishment for violence against children . The law sets a sentence of 30 years in jail for child homicide . The measure , approved by Congress earlier this month , was signed into law by Mr Garcia in the absence of President Evo Morales , who was travelling to Brazil . &quot; President Evo &#91; Morales &#93; intervened to make sure we found a balance between the reality and the law , between rights and international treaties , &quot; added Mr Garcia . More than 500,000 children already work to supplement the family income in Bolivia according to the United Nations Children &apos;s Fund ( Unicef ) . Many work cleaning shoes and selling food in stalls in La Paz and other Bolivian cities . But others face extreme conditions in mines and in agriculture fields . Mr Morales &apos;s socialist government hopes the law will help eradicate extreme poverty in Bolivia . The International Labour Organisation says children under the age of 15 should not be allowed to work . But it allows a minimum working age of 14 for developing countries . &quot; It would have been easier to pass a law in line with international conventions , but it would not be enforced because Bolivia &apos;s reality has other needs and characteristics , &quot; said Mr Garcia . The IL@@ O says it is studying the legislation to decide whether it breaches international regulations on child labour .

S-229	The Fermanagh MLA Phil Flanagan tweeted after Tom Elliott appeared on a BBC radio programme in May 2014 . On Friday , the High Court was told the tweet read &quot; Tom Elliott speaks to Steven Nolan about past . &quot; I wonder if he will reveal how many people he harassed and shot as a member of the U@@ DR . &quot; Mr Elliott served in the U@@ DR for 10 years , between 1982 and 1992 . He is now the MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone The High Court heard that he has a clear MoD record . The court was told that Mr Elliott was alerted to the tweet by the victims campaigner Ann Travers and by DUP assembly member Arlene Foster , who is to become Northern Ireland first minister on Monday . The tweet was deleted by Mr Flanagan within an hour of being posted . The apology , which must also be posted on Twitter before the end of Friday , will state that the Sinn Féin MLA accepts that his tweet about Mr Elliott &quot; was untrue and wholly without foundation . &quot; Mr Justice Stevens has reserved judgement on the amount of compensation . The court was also told that the insurance firm which in@@ dem@@ ni@@ fies MLAs at Stormont , has refused to cover Mr Flanagan in respect of any compensation and costs in this case . The Sinn Féin MLA is challenging that decision in a separate court action . In a statement , Mr Elliott said : &quot; I have been totally vindicated and Phil Flanagan has admitted that the comments he made were totally untrue . I am very disappointed that it has taken so long to get to this stage . &quot; This could have been resolved 19 months ago , but unfortunately I was forced to go down this route . Despite that , I am delighted with the result . &quot;

S-47	Fellow tenants Newport Gwent Dragons are subject to a takeover bid from the Welsh Rugby Union , who have said they see Rodney Parade &quot; as a rugby venue . &quot; County have a lease to use the ground - and have pri@@ macy of fixtures on the venue if they remain in the Football League - until 2023 . &quot; Our view is quite clear - we &apos;ve got a contract , &quot; Fox@@ all said . &quot; That is something that we &apos;re expecting to be honoured . &quot; Obviously there is a vote in early May by the shareholders for Newport Rugby and we &apos;ll wait and see what happens with that . &quot; The WRU &apos;s takeover of Newport Gwent Dragons will be put to the vote on Tuesday , 9 May . In 2013 the Exiles agreed a 10-year lease to use the stadium after gaining promotion to the Football League from the Conference . Newport RFC chairman Will Godfrey said both County and Newport Squ@@ ash Club , who are also based at Rodney Parade , are protected under their current agreements . Godfrey said the WRU had been made aware of that fact . The WRU have signalled their intention to install an artificial surface which is against Football League rules . On the pitch , County are two points clear of the League Two relegation with two games remaining after six wins in 10 games under caretaker manager Mike Flynn and can clinch survival this weekend if they win and rivals Hartlepool lose . Newport secured promotion back to the Football League in 2013 and Fox@@ all said relegation to the National League would be a &quot; massive &quot; blow , &quot; To lose that status again , in a relatively short space of time would be pretty devastating for the fans but also for the city of Newport , &quot; Fox@@ all told BBC Wales Today .

The Royal party are due back in the UK on Friday evening , after a five-day tour that began in Poland on Monday . On the last day of the tour , the Duchess , who comes from a musical family and played the fl@@ ute at school , took the musicians through the first notes of Beethoven &apos;s fifth symp@@ hony . The royal couple then listened to a performance of a symp@@ hony especially adapted for young people , and then went on stage to learn more about the orchestra . Earlier , Catherine and William walked around the stage accompanying six children trying out different instruments , including a violin , fl@@ ute , ti@@ mp@@ ani &#91; ket@@ tle drums &#93; and tro@@ m@@ bone . Later the Duke of Cambridge gave Prince George and Princess Charlotte a guided tour of a helicopter at the Airbus factory in Hamburg . Prince George tried on a pilot &apos;s helmet while Princess Charlotte played with buttons in the cockpit . The Duke flew helicopters when he was an air ambulance pilot . Antoine van Gent , head of flight testing at Airbus , said : &quot; The Duke was very relaxed showing his children the professional aircraft he uses . &quot; George was excited , with the first helicopter he wanted to sit in the cockpit and then he wanted to sit in the next one , he already knew there was a difference between them . &quot; Charlotte was less impressed after taking a tumble on the concrete after leaving the aircraft but Mr van Gent said she enjoyed playing in the pilot &apos;s seat .

S-71	Selby beat Xiao Gu@@ od@@ ong 13-@@ 6 in the second round to set up a meeting with either Marco Fu or Neil Robertson . The Leicester man , who beat Ferg@@ al O &apos;Brien 10-@@ 2 in the first round , told BBC Sport : &quot; I don &apos;t feel as though I have peaked , but that &apos;s a good thing . &quot; If you peak in the first or second round the only way you can go is down . &quot; Selby won the first three frames of his final session against Xiao to progress . He has only managed one century so far , but has looked comfortable and clinical after a consistent season which has brought him four ranking titles - including the UK Championship . Selby , aiming for a third world title , said his good form meant he is not being troubled by the weight of expectation that comes with being the current champion . &quot; I don &apos;t feel under pressure as much , but I suppose that &apos;s because of the season I have had , &quot; the 33-year-old added . &quot; If I had come here not having won anything and struggling for form , it would have been a bit different with the defending champion tag on my back . &quot; But that &apos;s not the case . I am relaxed , enjoying my snooker and it seems to be showing . &quot; Selby begins his last-eight match on Tuesday afternoon . &quot; I feel like my game has not been fantastic , &quot; he said . &quot; But it &apos;s not been poor . I am happy with that going into the quarter-finals . &quot; My opponent will know that when they play against me they will be in for a battle . I never give in and that has always been my philosophy . &quot;

S-317	Smith , 26 , already leads the one-day side and will also captain the Twenty20 team in the absence of the injured Aaron Finch . Fellow batsman David Warner , 28 , has been named as Smith &apos;s vice-captain . &quot; At 26 , Steve is a fine young man with extraordinary talent , &quot; said national selector Rod Marsh . &quot; He is highly regarded by the selectors and we congratulate him on being appointed to the role on an ongoing basis . He should be incredibly proud . &quot; Clarke , 34 , confirmed his decision to retire after his side surrendered the Ashes with a heavy defeat by England at Trent Bridge , which gave the hosts a 3-1 lead . Smith had already captained the side in three Tests against India last summer , when Clarke was recovering from hamstring surgery and back issues . The New South Welshman has played in 32 Tests for his country , scoring 2,9@@ 52 runs at an average of 54.@@ 66 . Media playback is not supported on this device &quot; When Michael made his decision to retire last week it was a very straightforward decision for us to nominate Steve as his successor , &quot; added Marsh . &quot; He has big shoes to fill but everything about him suggests he is the right man for the job . &quot; Warner has earned the vice-captain &apos;s role despite a history of disciplinary problems , and Marsh said of the opener : &quot; David has matured and developed into an important senior figure in the Australian team . He has come a long way . &quot; We believe that he will respond well to the added responsibility of leadership . &quot; Smith and Warner will lead Australia in the limited-overs matches that follow the final Ashes Test at the Oval , which starts on 20 August .

S-40	Faw@@ zi al-@@ Od@@ ah , 37 , was released after a US review panel concluded he was not a &quot; continuing significant threat . &quot; He had been at the US facility in Cuba since 2002 after his arrest in Pakistan on suspicion of links to al-Qaeda and the Taliban - a charge he denies . He had challenged America &apos;s right to detain him in the US Supreme Court . Mr Od@@ ah boarded a Kuwaiti government plane on Wednesday morning US time . &quot; There &apos;s no bitterness , there &apos;s no anger , &quot; his lawyer Eric Lewis was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency . &quot; There &apos;s just excitement and joy that he will be going home . &quot; The release came after Guantanamo &apos;s Peri@@ odic Review Board in July determined &quot; that continued law of war detention of ( Mr Od@@ ah ) does not remain necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the security of the United States . &quot; But he now faces at least a year at a militant rehabilitation centre in Kuwait , according to the terms of the release . The Kuwaiti government had pushed hard for the release of all Kuwaiti detainees at Guantanamo . Mr Od@@ ah had argued that he travelled to Afghanistan and Pakistan to teach the Koran and provide humanitarian aid . He is the first inmate to be freed since May , when five Taliban detainees were exchanged for US Sgt Bowe Bergd@@ ahl , who had been kept by the insurgents in Afghanistan . Mr Od@@ ah &apos;s release brings down the total number of inmates at the US naval base to 148 . The US opened the facility in January 2002 , following the 11 September 2001 attacks in America . President Barack Obama has repeatedly promised to shut it down .

S-137	He also cancelled an investigation into claims of abuse of power revealed by covert recordings , saying he wanted to &quot; put an end to the agony &quot; ahead of early elections in June . But his move was condemned both by the opposition and by EU officials . Macedonia has been in turmoil since the recordings were released in 2015 . In a televised address on Tuesday , President Iv@@ anov said he acted to &quot; defend national interests . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve decided to put an end to the agony and , met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ically speaking , to cut a knot , &quot; he said , without referring to any politicians by name . Opposition leader Zoran Za@@ ev said the move was illegal , urging protesters to gather in the capital Sk@@ op@@ je . A crowd of several hundred people later gathered outside the prosecutor &apos;s office . Meanwhile , EU En@@ larg@@ ement Commissioner Johannes Hahn said : &quot; Today &apos;s actions of President Iv@@ anov are not in line with my understanding of rule of law . &quot; Mr Hahn added that the move put Macedonia &apos;s EU membership ambitions at risk . The crisis was sparked by covert recordings which appear to show ministers plotting vote-@@ rigging and the cover-up of a murder . Mr Za@@ ev has been releasing a steady stream of recordings since February 2015 , accusing the government of wiret@@ apping 20,000 people , including politicians , journalists and religious leaders . He says that scores of leaked recordings reveal corruption at the highest levels of government , including the mismanagement of funds , dubious criminal prosecutions of opponents and even cover@@ -ups of killings . The government denies the accusations , and in return has accused Mr Za@@ ev of trying to &quot; destabilise &quot; the Balkan nation . He rejects the claim .

The Welsh government said it is waiting for advice from the Joint Committee on Vacc@@ ination and Im@@ mun@@ isation . Charities including Ten@@ ov@@ us Cancer Care and organisations such as BMA Cymru and Cardiff University &apos;s HPV research team will deliver a letter to the Welsh government on Monday calling for the vaccination to be rolled out . They told BBC Radio Wales &apos; Eye on Wales programme the number of head and neck cancer cases are increasing . Dr Mer@@ er@@ id Evans , consultant on@@ col@@ ogist at Vel@@ ind@@ re Hospital in Cardiff , said : &quot; I &apos;ve seen a difference in demographics over the last ten years . &quot; These are younger people with families , and three-quarters of those affected are men .

The Welsh government said : &quot; We will await the committee &apos;s recommendations and will consider the implications for Wales of any proposed changes to the HPV vaccination programme . &quot;

GB led 35-@@ 24 on Lawrence &apos;s three in the second quarter but the Dutch took the lead early in the third . Gordon then hit three thre@@ es in a row - his first points of the game - to restore GB &apos;s advantage . Netherlands , who were led by 18 points from Wor@@ thy De Jong , scored the first 10 points of the fourth quarter to lead 7@@ 1-@@ 60 and held on to win despite the hosts &apos; comeback in the last six minutes . P@@ run@@ ty was pleased with the contribution of Gordon , a player who has joined the team despite missing out on the place available to him for London 2012 . He said : &quot; You &apos;re always trying to find to your rhythm as a player and with one another . I thought he &#91; Gordon &#93; had a good showing tonight , he certainly had a very good stretch in the third quarter . &quot;

S-331	Mar@@ cy Smith was woken up by her son David to find their house in Glo@@ ver@@ town , New@@ found@@ land and Labrador , completely engulfed in flames . The whole family was able to escape , but their house is destroyed and their dog and cats did not make it . Mrs Smith said if it wasn &apos;t for her son , she and her daughter probably wouldn &apos;t have survived . David was on Fac@@ e@@ Time to his father at the time , so was the only one awake and saw the flames out of the corner of his eye . &quot; Within seconds of him getting us up , the flames were everywhere , &quot; Mrs Smith told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation . &quot; It happened so fast . We were standing in the kitchen by the wood st@@ ove and the flames just ate around me and David . The entire kitchen just disappeared while we were standing in it . &quot; She said the fire was started by some rubbish she burned in the wood st@@ ove , something she had done &quot; a thousand times &quot; before . The fire alarm did not go off . The family had nothing but pyjamas on when they fled , but Mrs Smith said the community has rallied behind them , donating clothes and shoes and even a bike for her son . &quot; All he understands is that me and his sister and him got out . He does not understand that he is the only reason we did , &quot; she said . &quot; He did a huge thing for such a young boy . I am so proud of him and I am going to tell him for the rest of his life until he understands what a big thing he did . &quot;

S-467	About 80,000 works of art , ceram@@ ics , manuscripts , letters and photographs faced being auctioned to help pay off the pottery firm &apos;s pension debt . But a public fundraising campaign launched in September hit its target in just a month . Ad@@ min@@ str@@ ators Beg@@ bies Tray@@ nor said the collection will remain on display at the museum in Bar@@ laston , Staffordshire . The Art Fund , which led the campaign , will gift the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum , before it is loaned to the Wed@@ g@@ wood Museum . Administr@@ ator Bob Young said it had been &quot; incredibly satisfying &quot; to sign off on the sale on Monday . &quot; Today &apos;s fantastic outcome wouldn &apos;t have been possible without the spirit of goodwill and determination shown during the often complex negotiations , &quot; he said . The Wed@@ g@@ wood Museum inherited Waterford Wed@@ g@@ wood pl@@ c &apos;s pension bill after the firm collapsed in 2009 . In 2010 the museum also went into administration , and in 2011 a high court judge ruled its collection could be sold to reimbur@@ se the Pension Protection Fund . Alison Wed@@ g@@ wood , whose husband Tom is a direct descend@@ ant of company founder Jos@@ iah Wed@@ g@@ wood , said the collection was &quot; important &quot; for Staffordshire . The collection risked being &quot; sold and scattered around the globe &quot; had the money not been raised , she added . Tristram Hunt MP , who was involved in the campaign , said the sale was &quot; fantastic news . &quot; &quot; The items contained within the Wed@@ g@@ wood collection chart a significant part of Britain &apos;s cultural development over centuries and play a crucial part in defining our national identity today , &quot; he said .

Rec@@ overed Fu@@ els Shipping Limited , whose site was run by Asset and Land Group , could not be contacted for a comment . It has until 7 August to appeal the decision . Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service ( GM@@ F@@ RS ) visited the premises nine times in the last 12 months . Geoff Harris , GM@@ F@@ RS area manager , said : &quot; The site operators , Asset and Land , have been broadly compliant with fire safety legislation throughout that time . &quot; The fire service raised concerns to the EA in February over the impact a fire could have on nearby residents , transport and the environment . &quot; The EA were very interested in our concerns , which resulted in our fire safety officers conducting joint visits to the site with EA staff , the EA decided to take enforcement action against the site operators , &quot; Mr Harris said . An EA spokesman said : &quot; After consideration of all the facts relating to the company and the site , the EA has now decided to revoke the environmental permit . &quot; Sub@@ ject to any appeal , the rev@@ ocation takes effect on 7 August , which means after that date the company will no longer be able to operate from that site .

S-132	The report focuses on the impact of sea level rises on the Daw@@ lish to Te@@ ign@@ mouth line which connects Cornwall and Devon to the rest of the UK . The line was closed for two months in 2014 after it was destroyed by storms . Network Rail said the study would be &quot; key &quot; to long-term developments . The report , published in the Journal of Transport Ge@@ ography , said that 10 % of journeys on the line , which was rebuilt and reopened in April 2014 , could be affected by 20@@ 40 . The report said adverse weather disrupted the line about 10 days per year , but according to sea-@@ level predictions that could rise to almost 40 by 20@@ 40 and up to 120 by 2100 . Academ@@ ics from Plymouth University , the University of Leeds and the University of York identified a link between sea-@@ level change and rail incidents over the last 150 years . The academics said there could be similar implications for other vulnerable stretches of railway throughout Wales , south-east England , the Cumbrian coast and Scotland . Dr David Dawson , from the University of Leeds , said the long-term future of the line was &quot; really worrying . &quot; The report predicts diverting routes could potentially cost billions of pounds . Network Rail said it hoped to develop &quot; long-term interventions &quot; to &quot; secure the future &quot; of the line . The Department for Transport said it had invested Â £ 31m into improving the resilience of the route and was &quot; exploring the potential for longer-term improvements in the area . &quot; In January , the prime minister backed a new O@@ ke@@ hampton railway route as the &quot; most resilient &quot; alternative to the vulnerable Daw@@ lish line .

S-113	The move is part of national fire service reforms unveiled by Home Secretary Theresa May last week . Sussex PCC Katy Bourne said emergency services would have an increased duty to collaborate under the new bill . But West Sussex County Council ( WS@@ CC ) said it already had an excellent model . East Sussex &apos;s fire authority said it would co-operate with the PCC but it believed collaboration could be achieved without elaborate structural change . Ms Bourne said she had written to WS@@ CC leader Louise Goldsmith and Phil Howson , East Sussex Fire Authority chairman , to request they begin to look at the feasibility of bringing both fire services under her authority . &quot; Just as we have one police force that effectively manages the county , we need to understand if one fire service not two could achieve the same , &quot; she said . Ms Bourne &apos;s letter met with cross-party opposition from WS@@ CC . And Ms Goldsmith also invited the home secretary to visit West Sussex and see an alternative to the government &apos;s preferred plan . Ms Goldsmith said West Sussex fire service was already integrated within the council and served communities . She added last year &apos;s Shoreham air disaster showed how West Sussex emergency services already worked together . East Sussex Fire Authority said it was willing to co-operate with the PCC to determine whether proposals could improve delivery of services and create efficiencies . In a statement , it added : &quot; &#91; The fire authority &#93; believes whilst close collaboration between the emergency services is essential , it can be achieved without elaborate structural change . &quot; It is also the fire authority &apos;s considered view that it is more accountable to the community it serves because its members are elected councillors . &quot;

S-70	Svetlana Kuznetsova will hope not , after she hacked some of her own hair off midway during a match at the WTA Finals in Singapore on Monday . &quot; I thought , &apos; what &apos;s more important ? My hair , which can grow , or the match ? &apos; &quot; said the Russian world number nine , complaining that it was affecting her game in a three-@@ set win over Agnieszka Radwanska . Unfortunately , many a sports star has failed to embrace this philosophy of substance over style . With the help of Sport@@ sday readers , BBC Sport looks at some of the worst sporting hair@@ styles . Former basketball star Dennis Rodman had a series of &apos; unconventional &apos; styles - this was just one of them . He also adopted the ble@@ ached blonde look long before Aaron Ramsey , Messi and Neymar re-@@ ignited the craze . Rodman looks like he has just caught sight of himself on the big screen and is seriously questioning his life choices - as is the du@@ de behind . Giovanni Simeone , son of Diego , was seen sporting this quirky style when playing for Argentine side River Plate . Y@@ ep , that &apos;s &apos; early n@@ ough@@ ties Joe Cole &apos; when he tried to make it tren@@ dy to shave your initial into your head and dye it red . Younger readers may be wondering if it caught on . It didn &apos;t . Former Arsenal forward Gerv@@ inho revealed he had a hair@@ line higher than his outrageous salary when he uncovered his forehead behind a pair of bra@@ ided curtains . It was the el@@ astic head@@ band that really caused a stir - it looked painful ! Striker Ronaldo decided this would be a good idea for the 2002 World Cup - Brazil went on to win it . Yes , the pinnacle of your career and you have that haircut , shown on the front page of newspapers round the world . Sorry Ronaldo . Br@@ illi@@ ant footballer . Aw@@ ful haircut .

S-427	Trainer John Gos@@ den let the unbeaten 4-7 favourite race after he walked the course and she beat runner-up V@@ intage Fol@@ ly by a length and three quarters . She goes to Ch@@ anti@@ l@@ ly next rather than the Oaks at Epsom , in which stab@@ lem@@ ates En@@ able and Cor@@ on@@ et are top contenders . Tas@@ le@@ et ( 14-@@ 1 ) took the Duke of York Stakes for trainer William Hag@@ gas . Jim Crowley &apos;s mount won comfortably from Mag@@ ical Memory in second , with Com@@ ic@@ as third . Sh@@ utter Speed , whose last run at Newbury saw her beat En@@ able into third , brought a fifth Mu@@ sid@@ ora win for both Gos@@ den and Dettori . &quot; We got away with it . The ground was very soft . It was hard work for her , &quot; said Dettori . &quot; She &apos;ll be a better horse on better ground . She &apos;s top drawer . Everything she does is very classy . &quot; Gos@@ den is concerned about the ground for his col@@ t Crack@@ sman in Thursday &apos;s Dante Stakes and will again walk the course before deciding whether he runs in the Derby trial . BBC Sport horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght Sh@@ utter Speed &apos;s clearly in very good order and she coped well with the so@@ ggy conditions . She &apos;ll be off to France &apos;s Oaks , staged over &apos; her distance &apos; of a mile and a quarter , and Gos@@ den will rely on En@@ able and Cor@@ on@@ et in the longer Epsom Oaks . The trainer said he was pleased to now have a month to prepare Sh@@ utter Speed for Ch@@ anti@@ l@@ ly . Meanwhile , the gap between Thursday &apos;s Dante Stakes and the Derby is just 16 days , so Gos@@ den &apos;s col@@ t Crack@@ sman may not be asked to line up in what &apos;s sure to be an examining Dante , in terms of both quality and going .

S-462	The NSPCC &apos;s Childline service said it counsel@@ led more than 4,500 children in the past year compared to about 2,400 in 2011-12 . The total number suffering online abuse is thought to be far higher . Some children as young as seven told Childline how they were tor@@ mented , abused and scared to go to school . The charity said online trolls caused misery and humiliation for thousands of children . Childline &apos;s president Dame Esther R@@ ant@@ zen said the figures should be a wake-up call . &quot; Bul@@ lying can wreck young people &apos;s lives , especially now that the bullies don &apos;t stop at the school gates , &quot; she said . &quot; Cyber@@ -@@ bullying can follow them home until it becomes a persecution they cannot escape . &quot; It is imperative that adults , parents and teachers , intervene to protect them , because we have learned over the years from Childline callers that bullying does not stop on its own , left alone it gets worse . &quot; Schools must take this problem seriously , and above all children must ask for help . &quot; The report is being released at the start of Anti-@@ Bul@@ lying Week which is coordinated by the An@@ ti Bul@@ lying Alliance . The group is working with parents , schools and other organisations to help combat the problem . One young person who contacted Childline said : &quot; It might sound like not much of a problem but there &apos;s a group of people I play with online and they told me to kill myself . I won &apos;t kill myself but it upsets me . &quot; My parents don &apos;t realise how upset it &apos;s making me and they tell me to stand up for myself or just not play anymore but they don &apos;t know how hard that is . &quot; I don &apos;t know why they have suddenly started picking on me but it hurts so much . &quot; Advice given by young people on dealing with bullying includes :

S-342	A formal complaint has been made to the European Commission by a group of Italian consumers &apos; organisations . They accuse McDonald &apos;s of forcing franchis@@ ees to pay excessive rents and high fees . McDonald &apos;s said it shared risks and rewards with its lic@@ enc@@ ees . In a statement , McDonald &apos;s said : &quot; We are proud of our franchis@@ ees and are committed to working closely together so that they have the support they need to operate their restaurants and their businesses . &quot; This approach , with the principle of sharing risk and reward , has been successful for many years and has helped create the best business opportunities for our franchis@@ ees and the best overall experience for our customers . &quot; The Service Employees International Union ( SE@@ I@@ U ) and European unions , including the Bak@@ ers Food and Allied Workers Union in the UK , are supporting the formal anti@@ trust complaint . &quot; McDonald &apos;s abuse of its dominant market position hurts everyone : franchis@@ ees , consumers , and workers . We strongly urge the European Commission to investigate the charges and to use all of its powers to hold McDonald &apos;s accountable , &quot; said SE@@ I@@ U organising director , Scott Courtney . The European Commission said it would now study the submission . It has the powers to launch an investigation if it believes the allegations are founded . The consumer organisations claim franchis@@ ees are prevented from switching to competitors because McDonald &apos;s makes them sign longer-@@ than-@@ average contracts . They also said licen@@ sees lease premises from the company at above market rates . It is claimed this leads to poorer consumer choice and higher prices in franchise stores as opposed to those owned directly by the company . Fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ees own and operate 73 % of McDonald &apos;s restaurants in Europe . McDonald &apos;s received $ 9.@@ 27@@ bn ( Â £ 6.@@ 40bn ) in revenues from its franchised restaurants worldwide in 2014 .

S-488	Lib Dem Lord Oates accused Labour of being prepared to &quot; concede everything , &quot; and the opposition &apos;s leader in the Lords , Baroness Smith , responded that his party was giving people &quot; false hope . &quot; The two parties had teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government concerning the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal . But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons . A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was &quot; fairly obvious grand@@ standing &quot; by the Lib Dems , and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets . &quot; It &apos;s pretty unforgi@@ v@@ eable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain , when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government , &quot; the source said . For their part , the Lib Dems &apos; Europe spokesperson Baroness Lud@@ ford accused Labour of &quot; waving through the government &apos;s plans &quot; and &quot; lining up with the Conservatives as they drive forward with a hard Brexit . &quot; It &apos;s not just on Brexit that the two biggest opposition parties have a track record of forming alliances - they have tro@@ oped through the lobb@@ ies together to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing . Baroness Lud@@ ford seemed san@@ gu@@ ine about their chances of coming together again , saying : &quot; The Liberal Democrats will continue to work with peers from across the House to fight for the issues we agree on . &quot; But the Labour source predicted &quot; residual tensions , &quot; adding : &quot; I can &apos;t imagine there &apos;ll be much demand here to organise a &apos; progressive consensus summer drinks &apos; gathering . &quot; Our respective leader@@ ships will of course continue to keep things business@@ -like . &quot;

S-355	Kemp , who last played Grant Mitchell in 2006 , said it would be &quot; a brief return . &quot; &quot; When I was approached about returning to EastEnders for Barbara &apos;s final episodes , it was something I could not turn down , &quot; he said . Following her surprise return to Albert Square , Dame Barbara announced her character would be killed off . Her character re@@ appeared on Friday , having left in 2010 , to tell her eldest son Phil , played by Steve McFadden , that her cancer had returned . After the episode , producers revealed that Peggy would die from the disease in emotional scenes to be screened in the spring . Now Kemp , who played Grant from 199@@ 0-@@ 1999 and then again in 2005 and 2006 , will return to bring the Mitchell family back together . &quot; Barbara is a very close friend , so when I learned of the storyline it felt right that the Mitchell brothers are reunited with their mother for the last time , &quot; he said . &quot; I am really looking forward to going back to EastEnders and filming what are set to be some classic EastEnders episodes . &quot; Grant Mitchell has been one of the soap &apos;s most memorable characters in its 30-year history , arriving in 1990 along with brother Phil . He was involved in repeated family dramas including having an affair with his brother &apos;s wife , Kathy , and having his brother go on to marry his ex-wife Sharon . &quot; Grant Mitchell is an EastEnders legend and finally he is returning home to Wal@@ ford to say goodbye to his mother and be reunited not just with his old loves but also his brother , &quot; said EastEnders executive producer Dominic T@@ read@@ well-@@ Collins . &quot; To have the Mitchell brothers come face to face again , having to face losing their mother , is an opportunity to show Ross Kemp and Steve McFadden at their very best . &quot;

S-260	However the Spanish champions insisted they had not committed any offence . &quot; The aim is to cover eventual interpretations that could be given to the contracts drawn up in the operation to sign Neymar , &quot; a club statement read . Barca paid £ 48.@@ 6m for Santos striker Neymar , 22 , in the summer with his parents receiving £ 34m of the fee . Between the initial fee paid in the summer , sign@@ ing-@@ on fee , wages during his five-year deal , agents fees and this latest tax payment , Neymar will have cost the club £ 10@@ 6.8m Last month , Sandro Ros@@ ell resigned as Barcelona president following accusations he misappropri@@ ated money . He is also being investigated but denies any wrongdoing . At the time of the move , Barcelona said they had paid 5@@ 7m euros ( £ 48.@@ 6m ) for Neymar but it has been alleged that , if other contracts are taken into account , the actual cost of the player was far greater . And last week a judge in Spain ruled there was sufficient evidence against Barcelona to continue investigations into the transfer . The club added : &quot; The board denies the existence of any tax@@ -related crime in relation to the fiscal obligations arising from the signing of the player . &quot; Given the existence of a possible diver@@ gent interpretation of the exact amount of tax responsibility arising from the signing and to defend the club &apos;s reputation and good name , FC Barcelona has this morning made a complimentary tax declaration of a total of 13@@ ,5@@ 50@@ ,8@@ 30.@@ 56 euros &#91; ... &#93; although we remain convinced that the original tax payment was in line with our fiscal obligations . &quot; There has not yet been any confirmation whether the case will be dropped after Barcelona &apos;s payment . Neymar has scored seven goals in 18 league appearances for Barcelona this season , as well as netting three in seven Champions League matches .

S-196	People for the Eth@@ ical Treatment of Animals ( Peta ) wants the mascot to be replaced with a modern anim@@ al-@@ friendly version . The group has suggested a fish with the slogan Skegness - A Happy Pla@@ ice . The mayor of Skegness said all suggestions were welcome but said he did not think there would be much support for J@@ olly to be axed . The original J@@ olly Fish@@ erman poster was commissioned by the Great Northern Railway to encourage visitors to take the train on their seaside breaks to Skegness . The poster featured the slogan &quot; Skegness is so bracing . &quot; It was commissioned in 1908 for 12 gu@@ ine@@ as and has became synonymous with the Lincolnshire resort . However , Dawn Carr , of Peta , said J@@ olly &quot; ev@@ okes images of cruelty to animals . &quot; &quot; Fish being tricked into imp@@ aling themselves in the mouth , animals being pulled out of the ocean in giant nets where they are so crushed together the pressure pushes their stom@@ achs out through their mouths and their eyes pop out . &quot; &quot; This is what the J@@ olly Fish@@ erman represents , &quot; she said . She said Peta &apos;s suggestion would give the resort an opportunity to rebrand itself as a progressive holiday destination . &quot; One where the mutilation and killing of sea animals is not being celebrated . &quot; Skegness &apos;s mayor , Carl Mac@@ ey , said the J@@ olly Fish@@ erman was loved by adults and children alike . He said : &quot; Animal cruelty is something we don &apos;t want to be portrayed for , but I don &apos;t feel J@@ olly has ever come across in that manner . &quot; He is just accepted as happy and friendly and he does such a wonderful job for Skegness . &quot; It &#91; Peta &apos;s suggestion &#93; will go before council , but if it isn &apos;t broken we won &apos;t try and fix it . &quot;

S-297	Dis@@ covered on land at North Elm@@ ham , near Der@@ e@@ ham , the circ@@ a 600 AD coin was created by French rulers of the time to increase their available currency . Adrian Marsden , finds officer based at Norwich Castle Museum , said the object was probably buried with its owner . The pend@@ ant was declared treasure by the Norfolk coroner on Wednesday . Mr Marsden added : &quot; This is an early copy of a By@@ z@@ ant@@ ine gold coin made in France . &quot; The Mer@@ ov@@ ing@@ ians &#91; French rulers &#93; created copies of By@@ z@@ ant@@ ine coins from their bul@@ lion as there wasn &apos;t enough coin@@ age coming in from the eastern Roman empire . How many of these copies were &apos; official &apos; currency is hard to say . &quot; The 23.@@ 5@@ mm diameter pend@@ ant , created from an imitation of a gold sol@@ id@@ us of emperor Maurice Ti@@ ber@@ ius ( 58@@ 2-@@ 60@@ 2 AD ) , features a suspension loop with three long@@ it@@ ud@@ inal ribs having been sol@@ dered to the edge of the coin immediately above the emperor &apos;s head . &quot; What &apos;s interesting is you have somebody in France copying a By@@ z@@ ant@@ ine coin which then also followed the trend of turning it into jewellery . &quot; Mr Marsden said the coin was likely to have come to England as a result of export trade at the time . &quot; We see very few of these so it &apos;s an interesting find and one that we will hope to acquire for the Norwich Castle Museum collection . &quot; Other items declared treasure at the coroner &apos;s inquest include an early-@@ medieval Carol@@ ing@@ ian-@@ style silver mount found in Barn@@ ham Broom , a hoard of 150 Roman coins discovered in Qu@@ id@@ enham and an early-@@ medieval bic@@ on@@ ical gold b@@ ead which would have been worn on high-@@ status neckl@@ aces .

He said he was keen to speak to anyone who remembered her from then , and who might have been in touch with her over the years .

S-44	Sylvia Blackburn , 72 , suffered serious head injuries outside Bedford Road Lower School , Kemp@@ ston , last December . Brian Wright , 55 , of Kemp@@ ston , told Luton Crown Court he had been blinded by the setting sun . He accepted he had struck Mrs Blackburn but denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving . Mrs Blackburn is now being treated in residential care . Judge Michael Kay QC paused the case for five minutes so Mr Wright could compose himself after he told the court how he had turned his victim &apos;s &quot; world upside down . &quot; Mr Wright said : &quot; I understand Sylvia was a much-loved l@@ olli@@ pop lady , who was loved by the children . &quot; I am truly sorry for what I have done to her and her family . &quot; Mr Wright &apos;s VW Golf failed to stop for a red light , the jury heard . The married mother-of-three , a l@@ olli@@ pop lady for 20 years , had been on duty in Bedford Road as pupils left school . When the traffic lights turned red , Mrs Blackburn , who was wearing appropriate clothing , stepped out to escort a woman and her six-year-old daughter across the road . Prosecutor Sally M@@ eal@@ ing-@@ McLeod said traffic in the other direction had stopped , but the defendant did not , and hit her . Mr Wright , of The Dell , said he could not remember if the traffic lights were red or green . &quot; I was totally blinded by the sun , &quot; he said . &quot; I just heard a bump . I was in total shock . &quot; Since that day I have thought of nothing else other than Sylvia Blackburn and her family and the position I have put them in . &quot; The court heard the sun was 10 minutes from setting and could have been shining into Mr Wright &apos;s eyes . The trial continues .

But he hit back with a birdie on the par-five 11th and a towering four iron from 229 yards on the 13th set up an eagle from just four feet . The former world number one ruptured a ligament in his left ankle during a game of football with friends in July , ruling him out of several tournaments . But he returned in time to unsuccessfully defend his US PGA title at Whist@@ ling Straits in August and played in three of the FedEx Cup play-off events before starting the new PGA Tour season with a tie for 26th in the Fr@@ ys@@ .com Open in California .

S-99	It comes after a jury concluded the death of a man from St Austell was suicide , while undergoing care 140 miles from where he lived . David Knight was killed by a train near St Austell after going on leave from a Somerset hospital . The Department of Health has admitted &quot; unacceptable &quot; patients &quot; are receiving care far from home . &quot; Click here for live updates on this story BB@@ S South West Political Reporter Tam@@ sin Mel@@ ville said county coroner Dr Emma Car@@ ly@@ on was understood to be satisfied there was a commitment locally to continue to work hard to ensure the lowest number of patients possible leave the county for treatment . An inquest in June heard that in May last year Mr Knight died of multiple injuries when he was hit by a train on the viaduct . The 29-year-old had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia when he died . A jury said his death was contributed to by an inadequate risk assessment and support while he was on leave from Cy@@ g@@ net Hospital in K@@ ew@@ stoke , Somerset . The inquest heard Mr Knight was being treated there because there were no acute psychiatric inpatient beds available in Cornwall . The NHS said 30 adult mental patients were placed out of Cornwall in 2015 / 16 , 150 the year before when a key unit was closed for six months , and 60 the year before that . The Department of Health said it had increased mental health funding to Â £ 11.@@ 7bn and had accepted the recommendation of the Mental Health Task@@ force that the inappropriate use of out of area treatments for adults in acute care &quot; must be eliminated by 2020 / 21 . &quot; &quot; We will work to a faster timetable if at all possible , &quot; said a spokeswoman . &quot; We will consider Dr Car@@ ly@@ on &apos;s letter in detail once it arrives . &quot;

S-68	The girl , aged 15 at the time , had met a man called David Ayrton in a Portsmouth garage in the autumn of 2004 . The defendant , now 34 and called Dav@@ ina , denied the charge . She will be sentenced on 4 March . Judge Ian Pearson remanded her into custody and said it was likely she would be held at a male prison . He added : &quot; If I were to release on bail there are substantial grounds to believe she would be a risk to herself and a risk of failing to attend for whatever reason . &quot; I will therefore have to remand in custody . It will have to be a male prison in Winchester but it will be an issue for the prison service . &quot; He also told the jury at Portsmouth Crown Court : &quot; It &apos;s been a slightly unusual case and it &apos;s not been an easy case . &quot; The court heard that Ayrton , who has learning difficulties , attempted to commit suicide last summer . Protoc@@ ols have been put in place for her detention at the prison , a court officer explained . During the trial Ayrton spoke about her sexuality , and said she she had not &quot; made any physical changes or enh@@ ancements &quot; to her body or taken any medication . She changed her name in 2012 . Portsmouth Crown Court was told she raped the teenager while two others were asleep in the garage . The victim said she shouted and swore at Ayrton to stop the attack , but her friends had not woken up . She had &quot; only drunk a can and a half of Foster &apos;s &quot; and clearly recoll@@ ected the events . The court heard that in 2014 Ayrton told a worker at the care home where she lived in For@@ ding@@ bridge , Hampshire , about the attack .

S-352	The decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a UN conference in Geneva on Wednesday . The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-@@ based rad@@ ars . MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board . Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radio@@ communication Conference ( W@@ RC ) , organised by the UN &apos;s International Telec@@ ommun@@ ication Union ( IT@@ U ) . The deal will enable satellites to receive trans@@ missions , known as automatic dependent surve@@ ill@@ anc@@ e-@@ broadcast ( AD@@ S-@@ B ) , that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations . This will allow &quot; real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world , &quot; said Francois R@@ ancy , head of the IT@@ U &apos;s Radio@@ communication Bureau . The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems . The current system leaves around 70 % of the world &apos;s airspace uncovered . Soon after the plane disappeared , Malaysia &apos;s communication minister urged the IT@@ U to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time . The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it . The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean . In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island . Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane . Following Wednesday &apos;s decision , IT@@ U Secretary-General H@@ oulin Zhao said the agency had &quot; responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking . &quot; The UN &apos;s aviation arm , the International Civil Aviation Organisation ( IC@@ AO ) , has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines . These will include aircraft sending their position at least every 15 minutes , or more in case of emergency , reported Reuters .

S-257	In 2014 , Sarah Roch@@ ira published the results of a major review of the experience of care home residents . The use of anti@@ psychotic drugs was a recur@@ rent theme which she has branded a &quot; national scandal . &quot; Health boards and care homes have said changes are being made . The commissioner is asking them to show significant improvements in practice . &quot; I know professionals don &apos;t like this phrase , but across Wales older people in care homes , through the inappropriate use of these drugs , are being &apos; chem@@ ically cos@@ hed &apos; . That &apos;s the reality of it . &quot; It is a national scandal . I made that clear when I published my review . I was very clear I would come back and look for evidence of changes and I &apos;ve now begun that process . &quot; I will publish the findings from the health boards later this year and I cannot be any clearer in my expectation that they understand how inappropriate the current situation is and that they can evidence real progress . &quot; Anti@@ psychotic drugs are primarily used to treat conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . A survey last November by the Royal College of Psychiat@@ rists found nearly one in five - 18 % - of dementia patients were being prescribed anti@@ psych@@ otics . The Royal Pharmaceutical Society in Wales published its own report into the use of medicines in care homes following the Ms Roch@@ ira &apos;s report . The society &apos;s director in Wales , Mair Davies , told BBC Radio Wales &apos; Eye on Wales programme that there were examples of expert practice . &quot; What we need is to make sure that happens in every care home in Wales , &quot; she said . Steve Ford , the dementia care lead for Care Forum Wales , which represents more than 450 independent care homes in Wales , believes progress is being made . &quot; We need to look at the underlying reasons for unwanted behaviour that challenges , rather than picking up the phone to the GP and requesting those prescriptions , &quot; he said .

S-244	The campaign was launched on 19 July by the Iraq War Families Campaign Group , which is made up of relatives of British troops killed in the conflict . It aimed to reach that amount to &quot; bring to justice those responsible for the war and the deaths of our loved ones . &quot; The campaign was led by Reg Keys and Roger Bacon , who lost sons in Iraq . The funding bid began after the publication last month of the long-awaited report by Sir John Chilcot into the 2003 invasion . Chilcot report : Fin@@ dings at-@@ a-@@ glance The campaign group initially aimed to reach £ 50,000 via crowdfunding , but extended its target after raising that figure in nine hours on the Crow@@ d@@ Justice website . It has now received enough backing to fund the whole campaign . Mr Keys and Mr Bacon said in a statement : &quot; This is great proof of the underlying support from the British people in our quest for answers and for justice . &quot; It is startling and humbling at the same time . &quot; The money raised will allow the group &apos;s lawyers , McC@@ ue and Partners - currently working free of charge - to analyse the 2.6 million-@@ word report by Sir John and prepare &quot; a comprehensive opinion approved by expert senior counsel . &quot; This would provide guidance on whether legal action against key people involved in the invasion of Iraq would succeed or not . The Chilcot report did not make any findings on whether individuals acted unlawfully . However , it rejected the legal basis for UK military action , and said then-@@ prime minister Mr Blair overstated the threat posed by then-President of Iraq Saddam Hussein and sent ill-@@ prepared troops into battle . Chilcot report : Cover@@ age in full Mr Blair has apologised for any mistakes made , but not the decision to go to war itself . A total of 179 British service personnel were killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2009 , when British troops left Iraqi soil . Tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians died over the period , though estimates vary considerably .

S-32	The much-@@ anticipated film sparked controversy last week after it emerged it would feature a &quot; gay moment . &quot; It was due for release in Malaysia on Thursday , but Disney said it was being held for a &quot; review &quot; of its content . The Malaysian Cen@@ sor@@ ship Board ( L@@ PF ) said on Tuesday it had approved the screening but with &quot; a minor edit concerning a gay moment in the film . &quot; Hom@@ osexual activity is illegal in Muslim majority Malaysia , although the country &apos;s tourism minister has said banning the film is &quot; ridiculous . &quot; A new release date has yet to be announced . The live-@@ action remake was granted a &quot; P@@ 13 parental guidance classification . &quot; &quot; We have approved the film so there is no more issue . Once a film receives approval , it means it can be screened , &quot; L@@ PF Chairman Dat@@ uk Abdul Hamid said . &quot; However , the date of screening and where the screening takes place is not under L@@ PF &apos;s jurisdiction . We only look at the content and give a decision on whether the movie gets approved or not . &quot; Local cinema chains have been offering refunds for customers who have purchased tickets in advance . Beauty and the Beast director Bill Con@@ don has spoken about the &quot; exclusively gay moment &quot; in the film . It involves Le@@ F@@ ou - the side@@ kick of the film &apos;s main ant@@ ag@@ onist Gaston - who tries to come to terms with feelings for Gaston that swing between l@@ ust and admiration , as a side-@@ plot to the main story .

Each time , he refused to give a direct answer , instead choosing to say &quot; my firm belief is we are all sin@@ ners . &quot; Mr Farron was asked by Andrew Marr why he voted against the Equality Bill in 2007 - a law which would have made it harder for businesses to discriminate against gay people . &quot; Let me be crystal clear , I &apos;m a liberal and I absolutely support equality , &quot; he replied . &quot; I &apos;m passionate about LG@@ B@@ T-@@ plus rights , for example , and as the leader of a liberal party , that is something that will be at the top of my agenda throughout the time that I am leader of our party . &quot; Not just defending the law on equal marriage , but also saying there are areas where it needs to be extended . &quot; Mr Farron said transgender people currently did not have equal access to marriage due to something known as the sp@@ ous@@ al veto - which means the husband or wife of someone who has changed gender must give their consent in order for the marriage to continue . He said the Lib Dems tabled an amendment to the Equality Bill because of concerns about &quot; protection of individual liberties &quot; and when that was defeated he voted against the bill . He did not answer directly when asked what those concerns were , but said : &quot; I am absolutely in favour of equal access under law for all people whatever their sexuality . &quot;

S-419	The bodies of David Miller , 24 , and Hannah Witheridge , 23 , were discovered on a beach in Koh Tao on 15 September . Metropolitan Police officers flew out last month to work with Thai police , who are holding two Burmese suspects . The UK detectives will now compile a report and &quot; update the families of Hannah and David , &quot; a spokesman said . &quot; Detectives from the UK who are currently in Thailand reviewing the investigation into the murders of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller have completed their work , as far as possible , &quot; the Met Police said in a statement . &quot; They will now be returning to the UK to compile their report and to update the families of Hannah and David on their findings . &quot; The police team wish to thank the Thai authorities for facilitating the visit . &quot; Za@@ w Lin and Win Za@@ w H@@ tun , both migrant workers from Myanmar , also known as Burma , are alleged to have confessed to the killings . Thai police have denied subsequent reports that the pair , both aged 21 , have since withdrawn their confessions . The two suspects are charged with conspiracy to murder , conspiracy to rape and robbery , and could face the death penalty if found guilty . However , the UK Foreign Office last month summoned the Thai charge d &apos;@@ aff@@ a@@ ires to express concerns about the police investigation . The concerns are understood to have been around the verification of DNA samples of the suspects and allegations of their mistreatment . The UK police visit came after Thai Prime Minister Gen Prayuth Ch@@ an-@@ ocha met Mr Cameron at a summit in Italy and agreed that a delegation of British officers could travel to Thailand . He had previously rejected offers of assistance . Post-mortem examinations found Mr Miller , from Jersey , died from drowning and a blow to the head , while Miss Witheridge , from Great Yarmouth , died from head wounds . Thai police have said DNA found on Ms Witheridge matched samples taken from the suspects .

S-378	Robert Fidler built the house in Sal@@ fords , in the Surrey greenbelt , in 2000 and hid it behind hay bales . He told Mr Justice Dove at London &apos;s High Court that his &quot; beautiful home &quot; had now been &quot; carefully dismantled . &quot; &quot; Hopefully , it will be rebuilt on another site with full planning permission , &quot; he said . At a previous hearing , Mr Fidler , 66 , had been told to tear down his home by 6 June or face jail . On Monday , Stephen Whale , counsel for Reigate and Ban@@ stead Borough Council , told the judge that Mr Fidler had made &quot; very good progress in terms of complying with the requirements of the enforcement notices , &quot; but that he had not &quot; fully complied with the requirements . &quot; The house had been &quot; very largely &quot; demolished , he said , but there was &quot; still more to be done , &quot; including restoring the land to its former agricultural use . He said the &quot; technical legal position &quot; was that Mr Fidler remained in contempt of court , but the parties had agreed for the matter to be adjourned for a month to give him &quot; an opportunity completely to comply . &quot; Re@@ presenting himself , Mr Fidler insisted : &quot; I broke no law . I was looking after my family . I acted in good faith . I am a law-@@ abiding citizen . &quot; He described the four bedroom castle as a &quot; work of art built lawfully , &quot; but said he would &quot; fully comply &quot; with the council enforcement notices . Mr Justice Dove adjourned the case until 4 July , but said he hoped it would not be necessary for it to return to court . Mr Fidler told him : &quot; I assure you we will not have to come back . &quot; At the end of the hearing , he said to the judge : &quot; When I rebuild my house , I want you to come and see it . &quot;

He was taken to hospital with a deep lacer@@ ation to his shin and puncture wounds to his calf , but said he would not be put off playing golf .

Police Senior Sergeant James Co@@ ate told ABC that the 1.2m ( 4ft ) sal@@ tw@@ ater crocodile had been in a waterway on the 11th hole Mr La@@ hi@@ ff , speaking from Cairns Hospital , said he had seen crocodiles there before and &quot; should have realised to be a bit more aware . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t see the cro@@ c sun@@ baking just on the edge of the water . I walked past it and then it got me on the way back and as soon as it grabbed me it took off into the water . &quot; He manage to drive himself back to the club house to get help .

S-88	Media playback is not supported on this device Sadio Mane scored twice in the space of 138 seconds as second-placed Spurs disappointed at Anfield . &quot; If you start a game like we start then it is very difficult , &quot; said Pochettino . &quot; It is difficult to fight for the Premier League if you show that lack of desire to play for a win . &quot; Chelsea can extend their lead at the top if they beat Burnley at Turf Moor on Sunday , and Pochettino added : &quot; If Chelsea go 12 points clear , it is a big problem . &quot; Spurs have won just twice on the road since 24 September , including defeats at Chelsea and Manchester United in addition to draws at fellow top-six rivals Arsenal and Manchester City . In their past 17 meetings with the other top-six sides away from home , Pochettino &apos;s team have won just once . &quot; In the first 45 minutes you saw a team that is not ready to fight for the Premier League , &quot; the Argentine told BT Sport . &quot; We are in a position that is up to us . But if you show like today that you cannot cope with the pressure then it is difficult to challenge and fight for the Premier League . &quot; Former Liverpool and Spurs midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day &quot; I couldn &apos;t believe what I was watching , they had the best defensive record last season and the joint best this year , but they were all over the place . Against the big sides they have played with a back three but they had a back four today , but I think they should have stuck with what they have done against the big sides - play with a three . &quot; It was so unlike Spurs , they do so well at home , but the contrast is amazing . There &apos;s a lack of pace , and a different mindset when they go away from home . They have to improve and quickly . &quot;

S-64	Harry Whit@@ lam died after Gary Green , 51 , of Brad@@ burn Road , Wakefield , reversed the vehicle into him at S@@ with@@ ens Farm , Rothwell , near Leeds , in August 2013 . Leeds Crown Court heard he was more than two times the legal driving limit . The court was told Green must have consumed the equivalent of 13 pints of beer before going to bed at 02 : 00 BST . Harry &apos;s mother Pam Whit@@ lam , who worked at the farm &apos;s cafe , said her close-knit family had been &quot; changed forever . &quot; &quot; It is not OK for anyone , whether on a public road or private land , to be drunk and get behind the wheel of a vehicle , &quot; she said . &quot; My hope today , now the court process is complete , is that Harry &apos;s life becomes more than one day and as a family we can again remember the good times we shared . &quot; &quot; We all miss him dearly and it has not got easier with time but harder , &quot; she added . &quot; Harry was my youngest son , a much-loved brother , grandson , nephew and cousin . &quot; The only memories I currently have of Harry are from the day of the accident but his life was so much more . &quot; Green , who was jailed for 16 months and two weeks , had previously admitted failing to ensure the safety of others . He was prosecuted under health and safety legislation rather than road traffic law as he was on private land at the time of Harry &apos;s death . During an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive ( HSE ) , inspectors found he had been walking towards a worker in a clos@@ ed@@ -off area of the farm when Green backed the tractor into him at about 09 : 15 on 9 August . HSE inspector Julian Franklin said it was &quot; an extremely tragic case &quot; and described Green &apos;s behaviour as &quot; reckless . &quot;

S-447	It comes in a shake-up of UK military buildings and re@@ settling of regim@@ ents . Brecon and Rad@@ nor@@ shire Conservative MP Chris Davies condemned the closure , saying there had been a barracks in Brecon since 18@@ 05 , home to troops who fought the Z@@ ulus at R@@ or@@ ke &apos;s Dri@@ ft . &quot; This decision is abhorrent and I shall be fighting it every step of the way , &quot; he said . &quot; The government has a great deal of questions to answer over why it is proposing to close a well-@@ loved and historic barracks in a vitally important military town . &quot; Brecon Barracks has served our country with distinction over its long history , with soldiers from the site fighting in every conflict since the early 19th century . &quot; This decision shows a blatant lack of respect for that history . &quot; Mr Davies said he was launching a petition against the decision , saying the Brecon area had some of the highest unemployment levels in Wales . He also hoped the closure would not damage the town &apos;s &quot; thriving &quot; military tourism industry . Brecon barracks has about 85 civilian staff and 90 military but it is not thought jobs are at risk . Mr Davies said he understood the nearby S@@ enn@@ y@@ bridge training ground and infantry school at D@@ ering Lines would not be affected . Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon told the Commons on Monday the reorganisation in Wales would see a specialist light infantry centre created at St Athan , Vale of Glamorgan . Caw@@ dor Barracks , Pembrokeshire - whose closure was previously announced in 2013 - will now shut in 2024 , while a storage depot at S@@ enn@@ y@@ bridge will go in 2025 . Responding for Labour , Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith , MP for Llanelli , said the ministry was &quot; right to restructure its estate . &quot; But she warned closing bases would affect the livelihoods of many people who would face &quot; gn@@ aw@@ ing uncertainty &quot; over their future .

S-124	The 10-year-old Irish-@@ bred horse collapsed after narrowly beating Thist@@ lec@@ rack to win the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham &apos;s Festival Trials Day . He was treated by veterinary staff before being pronounced dead . The British Horseracing Authority confirmed the horse suffered from a &quot; severe pul@@ monary haemorrhage . &quot; Tony Welsh , acting chief veterinary officer for the BHA , said : &quot; Epis@@ odes such as this are rare , and can occur in horses which have no underlying health issues , and amongst all disciplines of sport horses . &quot; In spite of the rarity of these incidents , as a sport we are determined to do more to understand what causes these symptoms , and whether more can be done to prevent it . &quot; In Saturday &apos;s race , King George winner Thist@@ lec@@ rack caught Many Clouds close to the finish but the Trevor Hem@@ ming@@ s-@@ owned g@@ elding , ridden by Leighton A@@ spell , fought back to win . Many Clouds had shown symptoms of post-@@ race at@@ ax@@ ia in the past , which had seen him over-@@ heat and &quot; wobble &quot; on his feet , but the horse had never collapsed before , and had shown no symptoms of post-@@ race at@@ ax@@ ia on Saturday . Many Clouds had previously won the Gold Cup trial in 2015 and the Hennessy Gold Cup in 2014 . Trainer Oliver Sherwood described him as the &quot; horse of a lifetime . &quot; BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght The crucial words here are &quot; no significant underlying health issues . &quot; On more than one occasion , notably after his Grand National success , Many Clouds received treatment for a tendency to &apos; over@@ heat &apos; , but he soon recovered , and his welfare was closely monitored by the authorities as a result . With that fact in mind , questions have been raised as to whether that condition was linked to his death , but this report concludes he was the victim of a haemorrhage rarely seen on the race@@ track .

S-22	Thousands attended the early morning service at Hyde Park Corner and up to 400 people took part in a parade before the wre@@ ath@@ -@@ laying at the Cenotaph . Anzac Day commemorates the first major battle involving Australian and New Zealand forces during World War One . A service was also held at Westminster Abbey . The national anth@@ ems of New Zealand and Australia were sung as the service ended . The first time Anzac Day was commemorated in the capital was when King George V attended a Westminster Abbey service in 1916 , a year after the Anzac ( Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ) landings at Gallipoli . Since then , the services have become an important moment for thousands of expatri@@ ate and visiting New Zealanders and Australians , who honour the sacrifices of their countr@@ ymen and women in all wars . Addressing the crowds at the dawn service , Alexander Downer , Australian high commissioner to the UK , who also laid a wreath , said : &quot; When we reflect on Anzac Day we imagine the Gallipoli landings , what it must have been like , at dawn on the water , in sight of that rugged shoreline - and a collectively held breath , a lea@@ den silence about to be broken . &quot; We consider the enthusiasm , the courage , and the hero@@ ism of the Anzac troops - ordinary men fighting for God , King and empire , for their mates , for adventure , for a world without war . &quot; Members of veterans &apos; associations , service and ex-@@ service personal and their families took part in the parade at the Cenotaph . Crowds , including Australia and New Zealand ex-@@ p@@ ats , lined the streets to watch the ceremony which featured prayers read by schoolchildren and the national anth@@ ems of all three countries . The eight-month campaign on the Gallipoli peninsula in Turkey was one of the bloodiest of the war and the allied operation was an attempt to force the Ottoman empire out of the war .

S-458	Roy Oliver , 37 , fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party in the Dallas suburb of Bal@@ ch Springs in April , killing Jordan Edwards , 15 . His lawyer has not commented . No date has been set for the trial . The policeman was sacked a few days later for policy violations . The death occurred when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party . Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots . Roy Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left the party . Police had initially said the vehicle reversed &quot; aggressively &quot; towards the officer , but footage discredited the claim , showing the car driving forward , away from him . He was also charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public official , in relation to the other four teenagers , including two of the victim &apos;s brothers , who were in the car . &quot; It is important to let our community know that justice is proceeding effectively and thoroughly at the Dallas County DA &apos;s office , &quot; Faith Johnson , the county &apos;s district attorney , said in a statement . The teenager was described by his coach as &quot; a check@@ list of everything you would want in a player , a son , a teammate , a friend . &quot; Roy Oliver faces five to 99 years in prison on the murder charge , the Dallas Observer reports . If convicted , he would be the first police officer convicted of murder in Dallas county since 1973 , the report adds . He is currently free on bail . Lee Mer@@ ritt , a lawyer for the Edwards family , said on Twitter : &quot; We remain cautious . A murder indictment for Roy Oliver is appropriate but the fact is it &apos;s been &#91; more than &#93; 40 years since a cop was convicted in &#91; Texas &#93; . &quot;

S-18	Stuart Campbell was arrested in the west of England on Friday following a complaint from a woman in south London . She had made allegations of harassment taking place over a two-year period . Mr Campbell , who was released on bail , said it concerned some tweets and insisted they were not threatening . He accused the media of &quot; in@@ nu@@ endo &quot; designed to encourage &quot; spec@@ ulations . &quot; The blogger , a former computer games reviewer who was born in Stirling but lives in Bath , has been a vocal campaigner for Scottish independence and launched the Wings Over Scotland blog in 2011 . On Friday he tweeted that he would be posting less frequently than usual because of &quot; reasons totally out@@ with my control ( don &apos;t ask ) . &quot; End of Twitter post by @ Wing@@ s@@ Scotland A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said : &quot; Police are investigating an allegation of online harassment . &quot; The allegation was made after a woman , aged in her 30s , attended a south London police station .

In a statement on the Wings Over Scotland website , Mr Campbell responded to a report of his arrest which appeared in The Herald newspaper . He said that piece &quot; has been written for maximum in@@ nu@@ endo to allow the wildest spec@@ ulations on social media - which are of course duly taking place - but the alleged events relate entirely to some tweets from our Twitter account , none of which have been deleted and all of which are still publicly visible . &quot; Nothing more sinister or serious than some tweets has occurred or been alleged to have occurred . None of the tweets involved are in AN@@ Y way threatening , not even in a joking sense . That &apos;s all we &apos;ll be saying on the subject at this time . &quot;

S-380	South Wimbledon and Queens@@ way stations will be the first to see their staff moved from ticket offices into ticket halls and on to platforms . Transport for London ( TfL ) said it would save £ 50m annually as it tries to save £ 4.@@ 2bn by 2020 . But Manuel Cortes , from the TSSA union , said London Mayor Boris Johnson was &quot; rushing through &quot; the closures . Mr Cortes , leader of the Transport Sal@@ aried Staffs Association said : &quot; Talks on the safety implications of closing over 250 stations have not even been concluded . &quot; The mayor doesn &apos;t seem concerned about how millions of tourists will cope with fewer staff to help them on their way . &quot; TfL said all stations would remain staffed and 150 new ticket machines would be installed by April 2016 . It added that new visitor centres would be created at larger stations such as Victoria and King &apos;s Cross to help visitors . Nick Brown , London Underground &apos;s chief operating officer , said more staff were being placed &quot; where they can offer the best possible assistance &quot; as only 3 % of Tube tickets were bought at ticket offices . He said : &quot; This forms part of our wider vision for the Tube , which includes a 24-hour weekend service on core parts of the network . &quot; But the changes have led to previous strikes by the Aslef and RMT unions . Labour &apos;s London Assembly transport spokeswoman Val Shawcross said : &quot; When he was elected , Boris Johnson promised Londoners he would protect the capital &apos;s ticket offices , but today he starts the process of dismantling each and every one of them . &quot; Whilst there is obviously a big role for ticket machines to play , there is no substitute for a member of staff . &quot; London Underground said after 100 meetings with unions the number of roles to be reduced had fallen from 950 to 8@@ 97 with no member of staff facing compulsory redundancy or losing money .

S-252	On Saturday afternoon , members of the public have been invited to take part in planting thousands of new trees at Brack@@ field Wood in the Fau@@ ghan Valley . The project has been organised by the Woodland Trust , and is one of four new woods being created across the UK . Its aim is to plant &quot; millions &quot; of native UK trees to commemorate the millions of people who died during WW1 . The four-year project is one of the trust &apos;s most ambitious planting programmes and uses the pledge : &quot; We will stand for those who fell . &quot; In Brack@@ field Wood , the conservation charity plans to plant 40,000 trees in tribute to the estimated 40,000 people from the island of Ireland who lost their lives in the conflict . The trust said it was inviting local people and visitors to the Fau@@ ghan Valley to &quot; get involved and to make a mark on history through the simple act of tree planting . &quot; Its director , Patrick C@@ reg@@ g , said : &quot; This is a special opportunity to make a personal and hands-on contribution to Brack@@ field Wood , still very much in its infancy . We do hope that as many people as possible will join us , roll their sleeves up , and plant a tree . &quot; By the end of the project , our aim is to have 40,000 native trees planted here at Brack@@ field , with car@@ pets of wild@@ flowers including iconic poppies . It will be a place where wildlife will thrive and where people can walk , relax and reflect . &quot; The charity is providing the s@@ ap@@ lings for members of the public to plant , and has advised volunteers to wear wel@@ ly boots or &quot; st@@ out footwear . &quot; Brack@@ field Wood is about seven miles outside Derry city , just off the Glen@@ sh@@ ane Road and limited parking is available for those taking part in the project . &quot; The trees , which will stand for generations to come , will be a living , growing tribute to the people from Ireland who played a part in the war : the soldiers , their families and loved ones , &quot; Mr C@@ reg@@ g said .

We will have to wait and see how Wayne is . He was a bit tired after getting back from the England match . &quot; We will have Ryan Giggs and Javier Hernandez available and there were a couple of others &#91; including Rio Ferdinand &#93; who I did not take to Sunderland . &quot; It was a battle in the second half but in the first half we played very well and deserved to be in front , and you have to give credit to Sunderland . &quot; They had a real go at us and made it much more difficult for us but we owe our win to determined defending and a lot of courage . &quot;

S-358	Lance Corporal Tri@@ ma@@ an &quot; Harry &quot; Dh@@ illon stalked Alice Ru@@ ggles before fatally attacking her last October . Her parents Sue Hills and Clive Ru@@ ggles described the moment two Northumbria Police officers knocked on their door . Prof Ru@@ ggles said : &quot; And then they said to us Alice has been killed . And we looked at each other and said &apos; It &apos;s Harry &apos; . We knew , we knew even then . &quot; The trial at Newcastle Crown Court heard Dh@@ illon had become obsessed with the 24-year-old and had stalked her . Dr Hills told of her guilt about trying to reassure her daughter on the phone two days before . She said : &quot; And I sort of reassured her that was ok , the police knew what was going on and that it would be all right and if she just ignored him he would ignore her . &quot; And I only put the phone down for 10 minutes and Emma ( daughter ) rang and said &apos; You cannot tell that to her , he &apos;s going to kill her . You have got to do something &apos; . &quot; And I thought she was over-@@ reacting so I just said &apos; don &apos;t be silly &apos; . &quot; And so of course as soon as I saw the police I knew that &apos;s that what it was . &quot; And I felt such a sense of guilt for having first of all told Alice not to worry and secondly told Emma not to be silly when actually if I hadn &apos;t said that Alice might still be alive . &quot; Prof Ru@@ ggles said he didn &apos;t think any of them , including his daughter , realised how serious the situation was despite the signs . Her parents have set up the Alice Ru@@ ggles Trust and they said they were hoping to use that and their daughter &apos;s &quot; vibrant personality &quot; to make other people aware of the dangers of stalking . They said they wanted her to be remembered for that and as &quot; smiling and laughing and making some sort of cheeky comment . &quot; Dh@@ illon , 26 , denied murder but was found guilty and sentenced to a minimum of 22 years .

S-128	The SNP &apos;s foreign affairs spokesman was not in the House of Commons to hear Prime Minister David Cameron make his argument for air strikes . The Scottish Conservatives , Scottish Labour and the Scottish Lib Dems were all critical . The SNP defended MP and MSP Mr Salmond saying he was on constituency business . A spokesman stated that Mr Salmond attended a &quot; full briefing &quot; on Wednesday from the security services and the joint chiefs about the Syria situation and there was &quot; nothing in the PM &apos;s statement which was of surprise or new . &quot; He added that SNP leader in Westminster , Angus Robertson , had responded as planned to Mr Cameron &apos;s address . And when the issue is fully debated in the Commons , Mr Salmond would make his contribution as his party &apos;s foreign affairs spokesman . After attending First Minister &apos;s Questions at Holyrood , the former SNP leader visited the Scottish National Portrait Gallery where he unveiled the painting , by artist Gerard M Burns . Later Mr Salmond is due to host a Scottish Parliamentary reception for veterans , serving armed forces personnel , and local community representatives . He will also brief MSPs on the SNP position on Syria . However , the long-@@ arranged portrait unveiling was criticised by Ms Davidson who said : &quot; There is nothing more serious than the potential deployment of our service personnel abroad . &quot; Alex Salmond has form in unveiling vanity projects to himself but he needs to remember he &apos;s paid - twice over - to be a parliament@@ arian , not an art critic . &quot; Mr Rennie added : &quot; Nothing gets in the way of Alex Salmond &apos;s ego including debating war and peace in our country and the Middle East . &quot; His absence from the Commons at this critical moment means we will be more sceptical about his motivations the next time he expresses outrage on the matter . &quot; A spokesman for Scottish Labour said : &quot; If Alex Salmond was chocolate he would eat himself . On the day that he had a job to do in parliament over Syria it &apos;s ridiculous that the SNP &apos;s foreign affairs spokesperson was in Edinburgh to look at a picture of himself . &quot;

Currently , the movement of HGVs are restricted in London between 21 : 00 and 0@@ 700 on weekdays , and between 13 : 00 on Saturdays through to 07 : 00 on Mon@@ days . Speaking to BBC Sunday Politics London Ben P@@ low@@ den , of Transport for London , said the Olympics showed it was possible to achieve a very significant change in when and how deliveries take place . &quot; Something like a fifth of freight activity moved out of the busiest times in the day and that was because we worked closely with the boroughs and the councils , the freight industry and the supermarkets and other people to make that happen , &quot; he said . &quot; So what that shows is you can make a big change , the question is how do you make that part of everyday life rather than a one-off thing for the Olympics ? &quot; Catherine West , head of transport on London Councils , said a balance was needed so that Londoners could get a good night &apos;s sleep . &quot; A lot of people live on busy roads and they live above shops . We just have to be mindful that a lorry delivery at 4@@ am may not be great for residents , &quot; she said .

S-311	He told Reuters that the EU should not interfere with &quot; domestic issues . &quot; He said he had already won backing from Poland that it would veto any move to strip Hungary of its EU voting rights . The EU objects to Hungary &apos;s tight controls on asylum seekers and non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) , as well as a higher education law . Critics say the education law could lead to the closure of the prestigious Central European University , founded by philanthropist George Soros . Thousands of Hungar@@ ians have held protest rallies against the laws in recent months . Asked by Reuters on Monday whether Hungary would back@@ track on any of the three issues , Mr S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to answered : &quot; No . Why should we ? &quot; These laws belong to national competence , so I think European institutions should refrain from making attempts at interfering with domestic issues . &quot; The minister added that &quot; my Polish colleague &quot; had made it very clear that Warsaw would veto any EU sanctions against Hungary . EU rules envisage that such decisions as stripping a member country of its voting rights should be approved unanimously . Hungary &apos;s right-wing Fidesz government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is under sustained pressure from European institutions to withdraw the three laws , two of which have already been passed , the BBC &apos;s Nick Thorpe in Budapest reports . Hungary is currently forcibly housing asylum seekers in secured shipping containers , raising serious questions whether it is compatible with EU law . Hungary &apos;s Higher Education Law , signed in April , could force the closure of the Bud@@ ap@@ est@@ -based C@@ EU , which ranks among the top 200 universities in the world in eight disciplines . Meanwhile , draft legislation on NGOs is expected to go before parliament soon . Human rights groups say it would stigmati@@ se them as &quot; foreign@@ -backed &quot; organisations . Last month , the deputy head of the bloc &apos;s executive Commission , Fr@@ ans Tim@@ mer@@ mans , warned action would be taken in coming weeks if there were no positive developments .

S-274	Walter Bar@@ tram was prosp@@ ecting in dusty terrain in Coo@@ ber P@@ edy , about 7@@ 50km ( 4@@ 66 miles ) north of Adelaide , in 1946 when he st@@ aked a claim to what became called the Fire of Australia . Although his family achieved success in op@@ al trading , their greatest discovery has been seen rarely by the public . That has just changed . The 99@@ 8@@ g ( 35.@@ 2@@ oz ) op@@ al , valued at nearly A $ 900,000 ( Â £ 550,000 ; $ 6@@ 80,000 ) , is now on display in Adelaide &apos;s South Australian Museum . Still largely in its original condition , the op@@ al &apos;s two polished faces reveal a kal@@ eid@@ os@@ cope of colours from green to yellow to red . &quot; When my father was alive , it was originally kept separately from all trading because it was such a significant piece , &quot; Alan Bar@@ tram told the BBC . &quot; We decided we would retain that intention , and keep it as a significant and obviously excellent example of light op@@ al from South Australia . &quot; The family has decided to pass it on for future generations to enjoy . The museum &apos;s director , Brian Old@@ man , said the op@@ al &apos;s rarity should not be underestimated . &quot; Op@@ al of this quality can only be created under certain climate conditions , &quot; Mr Old@@ man said . &quot; When our state &apos;s inland sea evaporated millions of years ago , it provided a unique sil@@ ica-@@ rich environment for the creation of precious op@@ al . It is these exceptional conditions that created the Fire of Australia . &quot; A mining town for more than 100 years , Coo@@ ber P@@ edy still draws people lured by the hope of striking it rich . &quot; They &apos;re becoming more scarce because the over@@ heads of mining now are getting to be so expensive - in fuel , explosives , machinery and living costs on the field , &quot; Mr Bar@@ tram said . &quot; But South Australia supplies about 90 % of the world &apos;s quality op@@ als . There may be more major finds . &quot; Reporting by the BBC &apos;s Greg Dunlop

S-360	A review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said there was no &quot; magic bullet &quot; to cure defects in the system . It said the council tax had built-in problems &quot; from day one &quot; but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers . The commission , set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla , will report back later this year . Prof Kenneth Gibb , from the University of Glasgow , was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world . He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a &quot; good tax &quot; because it was stable , difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets . But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection . Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income . Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax , used by many countries , was generally perceived as fairer . But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctu@@ ated . There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities . He said : &quot; It is clear there is no magic bullet . &quot; Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traum@@ as of past reform . &quot; So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies , change and reform is a major undertaking . &quot; The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn . A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system &quot; as a whole to be unfair . &quot; He added : &quot; That is why , along with our local government partners , we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives . &quot; The Scottish government awaits the commission &apos;s report , which is due in the Autumn . &quot;

S-4	The decommissioned Type 22 frigates HMS Cumberland , HMS Campbeltown , HMS Chatham and HMS Cornwall are currently moored in Portsmouth Harbour . Bid@@ ders had until 23 January to register an interest in the former Devon@@ port@@ -based ships . The BBC understands no proposals to preserve the ships have been submitted . Those who have registered an interest are finalising their bids with view@@ ings set to take place in late February and March . A final decision is not expected until the spring . The government &apos;s Dis@@ pos@@ al Services Authority , which is handling the sale , wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycl@@ er to determine the capacity of the UK &apos;s industry in the field . Penny Mor@@ da@@ unt , Conservative MP for Portsmouth North , said it was important UK recycl@@ ers had the chance to prove themselves in the field but she was also keen to see at least one of them saved from the scrap@@ yard . She added : &quot; For anyone that has served on a ship it &apos;s your home , you &apos;ve literally been through the wars with it ... and you want them to have a noble second life . &quot; My preference is to go for the reef and diving attraction . &quot; We &apos;ve got to get best value for the budget but a reef would also generate income for part of the country through tourism . &quot; The Ministry of Defence has previously said it will &quot; consider all options &quot; for the frigates to ensure &quot; best financial return for the taxpayer . &quot; A spokeswoman would not comment on the number or nature of the bids received due to &quot; commercial sensitivity . &quot; Originally designed as a specialist anti-@@ submarine ship , the Type 22 fri@@ gate evolved into a powerful surface combat@@ ant with substantial anti-@@ surface , anti-@@ submarine and anti-aircraft weapons systems . They were also known for having excellent command and control , and communication facilities , making them ideal flag@@ ships on deployments , with a complement of about 280 crew . Last year , the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal was sold as scrap for Â £ 3m .

The Pakistan Telec@@ ommun@@ ication Company Ltd posted on its Facebook page on Monday : &quot; Welcome Back YouTube . &quot; Pakistan &apos;s ministry of information technology said : &quot; Google has provided an online web process through which requests for blocking access of offending material can be made by the P@@ TA to Google directly . &quot; Google / YouTube will accordingly restrict access to the said offending material for users within Pakistan . &quot; However , a YouTube spokeswoman said government requests for the removal of content would not automatically be granted . &quot; We have clear community guidelines , and when videos violate those rules , we remove them , &quot; she said . &quot; In addition , where we have launched YouTube locally and we are notified that a video is illegal in that country , we may restrict access to it after a thorough review . &quot; She said requests by governments for content to be removed would be recorded in YouTube &apos;s Transparency Report . Pakistan &apos;s ban on YouTube was imposed by the Supreme Court in 2012 after the US-@@ made film Inno@@ cence of Muslims was uploaded . The amate@@ ur@@ -@@ made video was condemned in the Muslim world and sparked widespread protests for its mocking portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad . More than a dozen people died in protests in Pakistan . Bl@@ as@@ ph@@ emy is a crime in Pakistan and can carry the death penalty , although such a sentence has not been carried out . Google revealed last week that it had launched local versions of YouTube for Nepal , Pakistan and Sri Lanka .

S-159	Hilary won the Th@@ ea@@ k@@ st@@ ons Old P@@ ecu@@ lier Crime Nov@@ el of the Year Award in Harrogate on Thursday . Radio Times TV editor Alison Graham , who was one of the judges , described the book as &quot; an emotionally exhausting and powerful story . &quot; US author Sara Pare@@ t@@ sky , who created detective VI War@@ sha@@ w@@ ski , received an outstanding contribution honour . The accolades were handed out at the start of the North Yorkshire town &apos;s annual crime writing festival . Shetland and Vera writer Ann Cle@@ eves , this year &apos;s festival programming chair , said the crime novel of the year shortlist had been &quot; really strong &quot; this year . The panel had felt Hilary &apos;s winning book was &quot; so finely written and tightly written , &quot; she said . Someone El@@ se &apos;s Skin , a thriller that tackles domestic violence and so-called honour crime , is the first in a series of novels featuring Det Insp Mar@@ nie Rome . &quot; The author was able to conj@@ ure up atmosphere in very few lines , &quot; Cle@@ eves said . &quot; The subject matter was well done and well plotted . &quot; The other books on the shortlist were : Sara Pare@@ t@@ sky was chosen for the outstanding contribution to crime fiction award after her 23-@@ year career writing about VI War@@ sha@@ w@@ ski , a female private investigator from Chicago . Actress Kathleen Turner played VI War@@ sha@@ w@@ ski in a 1991 movie based on the Dead@@ lock novel and in a BBC Radio 4 adaptation . VI War@@ sha@@ w@@ ski was &quot; a real game changer , &quot; Cle@@ eves said . &quot; This was a woman who didn &apos;t just solve crimes but was like an action hero in a sense . &quot; Pare@@ t@@ sky &quot; really changed the way that readers thought about female writers , &quot; Cle@@ eves said . &quot; When she started writing , it was pretty well unheard of to have a strong female protag@@ onist , &quot; she added . Pare@@ t@@ sky also set up Sisters In Crime , an organisation to support female crime writers around the world .

S-270	The money for Bridg@@ water Community Hospital is part of the coalition &apos;s £ 3@@ 30m investment for new NHS facilities across England . Once built , the new hospital will have 30 inpatient beds , a mid@@ wi@@ fer@@ y-@@ led maternity unit , a minor injury unit and X-ray and space for mobile scanners . The current hospital was built in 18@@ 13 , but it has become cramped and outdated . The total cost of the project is £ 33m and the remaining balance will be paid for by NHS Somerset and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust . Mat@@ ron Sue Taylor said : &quot; It &apos;s very old and in the summer it &apos;s very , very hot . In the winter it &apos;s quite cold , there &apos;s lots of maintenance , lots of running repairs - it &apos;s a poor old tired building now . &quot; Sometimes your environment can have such an impact when you &apos;re trying to recover from an illness - we make the best of what we &apos;ve got but when you walk into a new build it just lifts you and gives you that feeling of well-being . &quot; There is a real lovely feel about this hospital and for many years it &apos;s served us well , but we need something more modern . &quot; In the past five years , three out of Somerset &apos;s 13 community hospitals have been replaced . Work has also got under way on the new Jubilee Building at Mus@@ grove Park Hospital in Taunton . Dr Donal H@@ ynes , a Bridg@@ water GP and medical director at Somerset Primary Care Trust , said : &quot; It will make a huge difference for me and my relationship with my patients . &quot; This is a great vote of confidence of the developments that have been achieved in Somerset where GPs , nurses , and therapists have got together to deliver a whole package of care that can be delivered in a one-@@ stop shop setting . &quot; Somerset P@@ CT hopes to build the new hospital on land at Bow@@ ers Lane , which will depend on planning permission . The aim is to get the hospital finished by autumn 2014 .

I just responded with &apos; did I win ? &apos; . That was all I was worried about . &quot; Williamson hopes to be back &quot; easy riding &quot; on a bike by the end of the summer and says she has the right support around her to make a full recovery . Media playback is not supported on this device &quot; I &apos;m going to get back on a bike eventually , &quot; she added . &quot; I &apos;ve got no timescale yet , but I don &apos;t know what level I &apos;ll be able to get to .

S-233	The Spain international has scored five goals in his last six games to help the Swans pull five points clear of the relegation zone . Four of those have been headers , and Clement believes his aerial prowess compares to the world &apos;s best players . &quot; Llorente is wonderful at heading the ball , &quot; he said . Clement continued : &quot; &#91; Cristiano &#93; Ronaldo is also fantastic , &#91; Gareth &#93; Bale also good from a striker perspective . &quot; You have to look at John Terry and Sergio Ramos , central defenders who always did so well when they went forward into the box . &quot; He &#91; Llorente &#93; is doing very well and he &apos;s proven to be a key player during this period . &quot; Clement worked with Ronaldo , Bale and Ramos at Real Madrid , while he coached Terry during his time with Chelsea . Since taking over at Swansea , the former Bayern Munich and Paris St-Germain assistant manager has overseen five wins from eight Premier League matches . That run of results has lifted the Swans from the foot of the table to 16th place , and Llorente has been pivotal to their upturn in fortunes . A summer signing from Sevilla , the 32-year-old scored two goals to give Swansea a vital 3-2 win over Burnley on 4 March and take his personal tally for the season to 11 . &quot; He &apos;s scored five goals since I &apos;ve been here - the two at Liverpool , one at Chelsea and then the two against Burnley , &quot; said Clement . &quot; What &apos;s helped him is he &apos;s getting good supply into the box , and that was very clear in the game against Burnley - not just the two that he scored but other opportunities he had as well . &quot; He &apos;s a very good player when you get crosses into the box for him . &quot; Meanwhile , Swansea will be without right-back Kyle Naughton for Saturday &apos;s trip to Hull with what Clement described as a &quot; minor &quot; hamstring injury . The 28-year-old is expected to return for the match at Bournemouth the following weekend .

S-365	Sheffield City Council said the cladding at Han@@ over House was not made of the solid aluminium panels ordered . The issue was spotted during fire safety tests carried out in the wake of the Grenfell Tower blaze . Councillor Jayne Dunn said : &quot; We will not stop until we get to the bottom of what happened . &quot; More stories from across Yorkshire The council announced on Monday that a single element of the cladding system , added to the 16-@@ storey tower block during a recent refurbishment , had failed new fire tests . Han@@ over House resident and tenants association member John Caw@@ thorne said : &quot; I personally feel betrayed . &quot; Ms Dunn , cabinet member for neighbourhoods and community safety , said the issue had been discovered following independent testing of the cladding at the council &apos;s 24 tower blocks . She said testing had been carried out despite paperwork stating &quot; there was absolutely no cladding apart from aluminium on our buildings . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s only when you cut in to it that you can see the layers , &quot; she continued . &quot; I can guarantee you that we will not stop until we get to the bottom of it because they took a piece of cladding to the tenants at a consultation and they didn &apos;t put that up . &quot; That was the cladding that we asked for .

S-65	The man is said to have been trying to gather details about a German parliamentary committee that is investigating claims of US espionage . German authorities have asked the US ambassador for &quot; swift clarification . &quot; The US National Security Agency ( NSA ) was last year accused of bu@@ gging the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel as part of a huge surveillance programme . The scale of the agency &apos;s global spy programme was revealed in documents leaked last year by a former intelligence contractor , Edward Snowden . The revelations about the NSA put a strain on ties between Germany and the US and raised feeling in Germany against American surveillance . The BBC &apos;s Steve Evans in Berlin says the new allegation of American spying on an ally may make it harder for the US to get German help in its efforts to oppose Russian activity in Ukraine , and also to control Iranian nuclear ambitions . German media say the man arrested this week is a 31-year-old employee of the federal service , the B@@ ND or Bundes@@ n@@ ach@@ rich@@ ten@@ di@@ en@@ st . The German federal prosecutor &apos;s office confirmed the man &apos;s arrest , but gave no other details . A spokesman for Ms Merkel said she had been informed of the arrest , as had the members of the nine-@@ strong parliamentary committee investigating the activities of foreign intelligence agencies in Germany . &quot; The matter is serious , it is clear , &quot; spokesman Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert told the Frankfur@@ ter All@@ g@@ eme@@ ine newspaper , Der Spiegel news magazine said the man was believed to have passed secret documents to a US contact in exchange for money . However , one unnamed politician told Reuters news agency the suspect had offered his services to the US voluntarily . &quot; This was a man who had no direct contact with the investigative committee ... He was not a top agent , &quot; the source said . Germany is particularly sensitive to reports of espionage on its territory because many of its citizens from the formerly communist east of the country were spied upon by the St@@ asi secret police .

S-195	In a telephone call , US Secretary of State John Kerry told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Y@@ i the US had &quot; strong concerns &quot; over recent developments . Last week , Chinese and Vietnamese ships clashed over the drilling rig that China has placed in waters near the disputed Par@@ acel Islands . China and Manila are also at odds over overlapping territorial claims . Beijing claims a U-@@ shaped swathe of the South China Sea that covers areas other South East Asian nations say are their territory . The issue has been rumbling in recent years amid an increasingly assertive stance from China over its claims . Last week , several collisions were reported between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels in disputed waters as the Vietnamese ships sought to prevent the installation of the Chinese drilling rig . Reports suggest the stand-off - involving dozens of ships - is continuing , with water cannon fire being exchanged . On Sunday , anti-@@ China protests took place in several Vietnamese cities . It is the most serious confrontation between the two nations for several years . In Monday &apos;s telephone call , Mr Kerry &quot; said China &apos;s introduction of an oil rig and numerous government vessels in waters disputed with Vietnam was provocative , &quot; US State Department spokeswoman Jen P@@ saki said . &quot; He urged both sides to de-@@ escalate tensions , ensure safe conduct by their vessels at sea , and resolve the dispute through peaceful means in accordance with international law . &quot; Separately , in comments made at a meeting with the Singaporean foreign minister , Mr Kerry called the Chinese move an &quot; aggressive act . &quot; Mr Wang , meanwhile , urged Mr Kerry to be objective on the issue , a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said . Tensions between Beijing and Manila are also running high , after the Philippines arrested and then charged nine Chinese fishermen with poaching at a disputed sho@@ al . The Philippines is in the process of taking China to a UN court over its territorial claims . It has also recently signed a new security deal with the US which would allow an expanded US troop presence , in a move seen as linked to Manila &apos;s deteriorating ties with Beijing . On Tuesday , Chinese state media slammed the Philippines , saying that if it continued to challenge China it would pay &quot; an unaffordable price . &quot;

S-150	My sources include collectors all over the world , dealers , auctions , fle@@ a markets , and just about any place I can think of . The accumulation , as I like to call it , includes all kinds of material related to the Indian match@@ box industry . Within this rapidly growing accumulation , I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a them@@ atic approach . My recent exhibition , titled &quot; Match@@ box Lab@@ els And The Stories They Tell , &quot; features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the match@@ box industry . I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000 . AE Match@@ es@@ wala was an early match@@ box label which started using sulphur . It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Kham@@ b@@ hat ( also known as Cam@@ bay ) in Gujarat state , and continued to trade in match@@ boxes until after World War Two . The company exported its match@@ boxes to Arab countries . Am@@ barn@@ ath , written in Hindi on this label , was the location of the first Wim@@ co factory in western Maharashtra state . Very few Wim@@ co labels used Indian languages and they did not last long . This rather dra@@ b label featuring the d@@ how is not one of their common brands . This label promoted the Sw@@ ad@@ eshi ( self-@@ reliance ) movement during the partition of India &apos;s Bengal region in 1905 . A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods . Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fer@@ vour to their brands . Lab@@ els from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India &apos;s struggle for freedom . Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement . It &apos;s believed that this match@@ box was commissioned by the royal family of Bha@@ v@@ nag@@ ar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule . Little is known about such match@@ boxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today . Many Bollywood films were promoted on match@@ boxes in the 1950s . Some labels even featured Pakistani films . Actors and film posters continue to be featured on match@@ boxes today .

S-96	Mr Abbott told Australian media that the only way to prevent people dying at sea was to &quot; stop the boats . &quot; Australia det@@ ains any migrants trying to reach its shores by boat , and takes them to offshore processing camps to be eventually resettled elsewhere . On Thursday , the New York Times described the policy as &quot; brutal . &quot; In an editorial , the newspaper said the &quot; ruthlessly effective &quot; policy was &quot; inhumane , of dubious legality and stri@@ kingly at odds with the country &apos;s tradition of welcoming people fleeing persecution and war . &quot; It said it would be &quot; un@@ consci@@ onable &quot; for European leaders to consider adopting similar policies , as Mr Abbott has previously suggested . Australia has not responded to the editorial , but on Friday Mr Abbott said the image of Syrian three-year-old Alan Kurdi , who died trying to reach Greece by boat with his family , was &quot; very sad . &quot; &quot; If you want to stop the deaths , if you want to stop the drow@@ nings you have got to stop the boats , &quot; he told ABC Radio . &quot; Thankfully , we have stopped that in Australia because we have stopped the illegal boats . &quot; On Thursday , Mr Abbott angered Australian Jewish groups by saying the so-called Islamic State ( IS ) , from which many of the migrants to Europe are fleeing , was worse than the Nazis . &quot; The Nazis did terrible evil , but they had a sufficient sense of shame to try to hide it , &quot; he told Sydney Radio 2@@ GB . But IS militants , he said , &quot; boast about their evil , this is the extraordinary thing . &quot; The Executive Council of Australian Jew@@ ry Robert Goo@@ t said the comment was &quot; in@@ jud@@ icious and unfortunate , &quot; saying there was &quot; a fundamental difference between organised acts of terrorism and a genocide systematically implemented by a state as essential policy . &quot; &quot; The crimes of Islamic State are indeed horrific but cannot be compared to the systematic round-up of millions of people and their despatch to purpose-built death camps for mass murder , &quot; he told Australian media . Mr Abbott later said he stood by his comments , but that he was not in the &quot; business of ranking evil . &quot;

S-296	As a teenager he tried three times , unsuccessfully , to defect from Cuba , once spending a month in Cuban jail . He finally escaped to Mexico on his fourth attempt , saving his mother from drowning on their boat trip over . He and his mother were then reunited with his father in T@@ ampa , Florida where he had fled two years earlier . But Fernandez &apos;s transition from his life in Cuba was difficult . Baseball helped him acc@@ lim@@ ate to his new American life . After starting at Alonso High School in T@@ ampa , speaking almost no English , Fernandez steered the baseball team to two state championships . He was drafted by the Mar@@ lins in 2011 at 20 years old and named National League R@@ ook@@ ie of the Year in 2013 . The Miami Herald reported his grandmother , a loyal supporter , often stood on her roof in Cuba during his games to listen to the sports radio broadcast as her grandson played . Players and fans described him as enthusiastic , energetic and charismatic . Many Cubans from Miami &apos;s Latin community , felt that the player embodied their own struggles . Miguel Gar@@ ay , 78 , a Mi@@ am@@ ian who came from Cuba &apos;s Pin@@ ar del Rio said : &quot; His story was our story . &quot; There &apos;s such a great tradition of baseball in Cuba and he embodied it better than anyone . &quot; After undergoing surgery in 2014 for a torn elbow ligament Fernandez became a US citizen in 2015 , where he gave the keynote speech at his citizenship ceremony . He said : &quot; This is one of my important accompl@@ ishments . I &apos;m an American citizen now - I &apos;m one of them . I consider myself now to be free . &quot; Fernandez was described as an &quot; avid fisherman &quot; and was aboard a friend &apos;s boat when the vessel hit a jet@@ ty , causing it to cap@@ size . He had revealed recently that his girlfriend was pregnant . Mar@@ lins President David Samson said at a news conference : &quot; When you talk about tragedy like this there are no words that come to mind . &quot; There is prayer and thought toward his family and his soon to be born daughter .

S-372	John Clancy , Labour councillor for Quinton , beat closest rival Penny Hol@@ brook in Monday night &apos;s ballot . Ahead of the vote , he said providing new homes and improving existing social housing should be the authority &apos;s &quot; top priority . &quot; He will officially replace Sir Albert B@@ ore on 1 December . Mr Clancy , who has bid to become leader of the city council several times , was chosen in the ballot by the authority &apos;s 78 Labour councillors . Updates on this story and others on Birmingham and Black Country Sir Albert announced he would stand down as head of the self-styled &quot; largest local authority in Europe . &quot; A close call for a man waiting in the wings for more than a decade . John Clancy has become leader of the Labour group after five attempts - and by just one vote . He will officially become leader of Birmingham City Council on 1st December when it &apos;s ratified at full council . An English teacher for many years , he &apos;s no stranger to working in the public sector but he also had a spell as a solicitor , as well as a business lecturer . His big message at a hustings last week was the council under his leadership can provide smarter financial decisions , political openness and free school meals for all primary age children . Some critics from within the party are already saying they &apos;re worried he won &apos;t have the clout or the vision to make the huge and rapid improvement needed to keep government commissioners at bay . The former Labour group leader &apos;s departure followed two other senior party figures , who resigned after criticising the way city was being run . Ian Ward , the deputy leader of the local authority and councillor Barry Henley also stood for the position . Mr Clancy , a former teacher and lecturer , has also pledged to widen access to free school meals for primary school children and expand regeneration outside the city centre . Birmingham City Council has found itself under scrutiny from a government-@@ appointed independent panel . The panel was appointed at Sir Bob Ker@@ sl@@ ake &apos;s recommendation to oversee changes at the council . Sir Bob &apos;s study was commissioned after a series of reports focussed on the council during an inquiry into the so-called Trojan Horse letter .

S-87	The regulator , NHS Improvement , said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill . Last year £ 3.@@ 6bn was spent on agency staff , but the regulator wants that brought down by £ 1bn by the end of this financial year . A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £ 600m , the regulator said . It means hospitals , mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55 % above normal shift rates for any staff , from doctors and nurses to administration staff . Only senior managers are exempted . The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them . Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs , such as National Insurance contributions , when it buys them in . NHS Improvement said the progress being made was &quot; promising , &quot; but it still leaves the NHS short . The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10 % down on where they wanted to be . And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen . The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS &quot; bank &quot; staff - effectively the health service &apos;s in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime . NHS Improvement said it would start publishing &quot; league tables &quot; of the best and worst-@@ performing trusts on agency spending later this year . Information on the 20 highest-@@ earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work . It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors . In one case a trust was quoted £ 130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £ 76 , while another was quoted £ 70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £ 35 . NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said : &quot; The NHS simply doesn &apos;t have the money to keep for@@ king out for hugely expensive agency staff . There &apos;s much more to be done . &quot;

S-261	A journalist and stock market officials are among those arrested , Xinhua said . It gave no other details . Chinese shares fell by nearly 8 % after a week of volatile trading that spread fear to global markets . The Tianjin explosions killed 150 people - with 23 still missing . A total of 36@@ 7 people remain in hospital after the 12 August blast at a warehouse where large amounts of toxic chemicals were stored . Twenty are in critical condition , according to Xinhua . Separately , the UK &apos;s Financial Times says Chinese leaders feel they mis@@ handled their stock market rescue efforts . The paper , quoting an account of a meeting of senior regulatory officials on Thursday , said the government had decided to abandon attempts to boost the stock market and instead step up efforts to punish people suspected of &quot; destabilising the market . &quot; Chinese authorities tightly control information online and have previously prosecuted internet users for spreading rumours . The rumours described by the latest statement include reports that a man had jumped to his death in Beijing due to the stock market slump and that as many as 1,300 people were killed in Tianjin blasts , Xinhua said . The news agency said &quot; sedi@@ tious rumours about China &apos;s upcoming commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II &quot; were also among the offences . A journalist was also arrested along with several stock market officials , according to a Xinhua report . The journalist , Wang Xia@@ ol@@ u , is accused of &quot; spreading fake information &quot; about the market slump , the report said . The state news agency said Mr Wang confessed that he &quot; wrote fake report on Chinese stock market based on hear@@ say and his own subjective gu@@ esses without conducting due ver@@ ifications . &quot; In 2013 Chinese authorities introduced a possible three-year sentence for spreading rumours - the sentence was supposed to apply to anyone who posted a rumour that was re@@ posted 500 times or viewed 5,000 times . Last year , Q@@ in Z@@ hi@@ hui , a blogger , was sentenced to three years in a government crackdown on internet rumours . Mr Q@@ in was found guilty of &quot; s@@ lander &quot; and &quot; picking quar@@ rels and provoking troubles , &quot; state broadcaster CCTV said at the time .

S-496	The 32-year-old joined the National League side following his release by the Cumbrians at the end of last season after a two-year spell . Sweeney , who is originally from Stock@@ ton-on-@@ Tees , spent 13 years at Hartlepool , making 4@@ 44 appearances . &quot; It obviously was a factor , &quot; Sweeney said of the region &apos;s appeal . &quot; I &apos;ve got a young family at home , but it wasn &apos;t the be all and end all . I was quite happy to move away if needs be but luckily enough I didn &apos;t have to . &quot; Everything fell into place here and I &apos;m quite confident we &apos;ll have a decent season and it &apos;ll prove a good move . &quot; Sweeney was manager Neil A@@ spin &apos;s sixth addition this summer , which has now risen to 13 following the addition of left-back George Smith . Chairman Richard Bennett who along with wife Julie took over the club in May 2015 , have targeted the Football League and maintained the club &apos;s full-time status . &quot; It &apos;s always been a club - with me being from the North East - that I &apos;ve looked out for on the results and followed , &quot; Sweeney added . &quot; I sat down with them and he &#91; Bennett &#93; discussed the plans he wanted to do and they matched my own ambitions , which I &apos;ve made no bones about . &quot; I still feel I can contribute in league football and hopefully that will be with Gateshead . &quot; The Tyn@@ es@@ iders began their pre-season training on Wednesday as they look to push for promotion to the English Football League for the first time in the club &apos;s history . Sweeney , who spent his entire career playing in the Football League , says success in non-league can be transfer to the higher tiers of the English football pyramid , as Crawley , Stevenage and Fleetwood Town have previously shown . &quot; Its momentum , it &apos;s all about momentum , &quot; admitted Sweeney . &quot; If you can get out of this league , I &apos;m not sure there &apos;s a great deal of difference between League Two and the National League . &quot; So if you &apos;ve got that momentum and you go into that league , you can carry that on quite easily . &quot;

S-236	Wenger , whose club contract runs to the summer , has been linked with the job . Southgate succeeded Sam Allardyce in September and oversaw England &apos;s 2-0 win against Malta as well the disappointing 0-0 draw with Slovenia on Tuesday . Wenger said Southgate &quot; has accumulated experiences and is a good observer of what &apos;s going on in the national team . &quot; Of his own links to the role , the 66-year-old Frenchman added : &quot; I focus on my job , that &apos;s what it is about . &quot; Former England international Southgate , 46 , has a World Cup qualifier against Scotland at Wembley on 11 November and a friendly against Spain four days later to persuade the Football Association to give him the job on a permanent basis . Wenger continued : &quot; We &apos;re in a job where you get questioned , especially if you have less experience , and the only answer he can give is by showing the decisions he makes are right . &quot; There &apos;s always a demand for big names but the most important thing is the person &apos;s compet@@ ency . He has a good opportunity and I &apos;m happy he has a chance to show he has the quality . &quot; Speaking before his side &apos;s game against Swansea on Saturday , Wenger added that 21-year-old defender Hector Bell@@ erin would be offered a new contract by the club . The Arsenal right-back has been linked with a move , with both Barcelona and Manchester City said to be interested , but Wenger said he was &quot; surprised &quot; by the speculation surrounding the Spain international , who progressed through Barcelona &apos;s La Ma@@ sia academy before joining Arsenal in 2011 . &quot; He has nearly three years to go and we always try get the players to the level where we think they deserve to be . So we try to extend , certainly , his contract , &quot; said Wenger . &quot; For me , his long-term future is here . &quot; Wenger added that midfielder Aaron Ramsey , 25 , will miss &quot; one or two &quot; more games , having injured a hamstring during Arsenal &apos;s opening-@@ day Premier League defeat by Liverpool on 14 August .

S-432	The incident began on Tuesday morning when border agents encountered two men carrying back@@ packs five miles ( 8km ) east of Sum@@ as , Washington , in the US . Authorities say agents interrupted an attempt to smuggle a load of MDMA , or ecstasy , from Canada to San Francisco . Two others were arrested and accused of planning to transport the drugs . On Tuesday morning , US border agents ordered the two men they encountered near the border to halt , officials said . One of the men dropped his backpack , fired a weapon at the agents , and ran , according to a criminal complaint filed in US federal court in Washington on Wednesday . The officers took the other man , identified as Jeffrey La@@ viol@@ ette , into custody immediately . Canadian and US police searched for the fugitive on foot and by helicopter , putting up road blocks . Nathan Hall , a Canadian citizen , was arrested by the Abbot@@ sford Police Department in British Columbia early on Wednesday morning . According to border patrol agents , the back@@ packs Mr Hall and Mr La@@ viol@@ ette were carrying contained a total of 58@@ lb ( 26@@ kg ) of ecstasy . Also inside one backpack was a California driver &apos;s licence with the name of William Nick@@ erson but a picture of Nathan Hall , the complaint alleges . Investigators later arrested a Bell@@ ingham , Washington woman , K@@ ali Hen@@ if@@ in , who they say planned to pick the two men up at the border . They also arrested her boyfriend , Ryan Lambert , who allegedly told officers he was to be paid $ 11,000 ( Â £ 7,@@ 270 ) to drive the drugs to San Francisco . Ms Hen@@ if@@ in told agents they had been monitoring police radio communication on a mobile phone when they heard a report of a shooting and left the area , according to the complaint . The three defendants in US custody face conspiracy as well as drug possession and distribution charges . The wooded area a few miles east of a highway border crossing is a well-known smuggling route for drugs and firearms , and a spokeswoman for the US attorney for the Western District of Washington told the BBC smuggling prosecutions are &quot; a large part of our practice . &quot;

S-336	The Northern Irishman , twice a winner of the European Tour &apos;s season-@@ finale , stumbled to a three-@@ over-par 75 to lie joint 5@@ 5th in a 60-@@ man field . McIlroy , 27 , has never finished worse than 11th in his seven appearances at Jum@@ eir@@ ah Golf Estates in Dubai . Westwood , meanwhile , carded seven birdies and just one bogey in his 66 . The 43-year-old Englishman found out earlier this week he would not be competing in the World Cup in Melbourne next week . Westwood &apos;s partner Danny Willett pulled out because of a back problem , and his place went to Chris Wood . Under tournament rules , Wood was able to select his own partner and opted for Andy Sullivan . &quot; I &apos;m disappointed not to be playing , &quot; said Westwood . &quot; I can understand him picking a mate and he has picked a very good player . It is probably more to do with the rules than anything . &quot; The Tour Championship is the final event of the Race to Dubai , with four players still in with a chance of topping the European Tour Order of Mer@@ it . Henrik Stenson , holder of a cour@@ se-@@ record 25 under at the Earth Course , leads but Willett can leapfrog the Swede should he win the tournament . Willett would also top the list if he finishes second and neither Stenson nor Alex N@@ oren win in Dubai . N@@ oren , another Swede , needs to finish at least second and hope Stenson and Willett finish down the field . McIlroy has an outside chance which requires several per@@ mutations falling into place - including Stenson finishing no higher than 4@@ 6th in the 60-@@ man field . It took McIlroy 14 holes to register his first birdie of the day , and although he swiftly added another on the next , the four-time major winner double-@@ bogeyed the 16th after needing two attempts - the second minus his right shoe and s@@ ock - to play from the edge of a water hazard . Westwood &apos;s former Ryder Cup partner Nicolas Col@@ sa@@ erts and France &apos;s Julien Qu@@ es@@ ne share second place on five under , with Sergio Garcia , Francesco Mol@@ in@@ ari and Jo@@ ost Lu@@ it@@ en a shot further back .

S-313	Cynthia Cher@@ o@@ iti@@ ch , 19 , said she drank body l@@ otion because she was hungry and thirsty . She was only brought out on Saturday morning after security forces found a teacher she knew to convince her it was safe to come out . Ms Cher@@ o@@ iti@@ ch said her ordeal began at around 05 : 30 ( 02 : 30 GMT ) on Thursday when she and her fellow students were in class studying for their exams . &quot; Suddenly , we heard the bullets and then we started coming out and then we said : &apos; What is happening ? &apos; &quot; she told the Associated Press news agency . &quot; We ran to our rooms , then these people came running , following us . When we reached our rooms , we hide under the beds . &quot; She said that their pursu@@ ers told them to come out of their hiding places , but she decided to hide in the wardrobe instead where she covered herself with some clothes . It was then that the gunmen entered the room . Ms Cher@@ o@@ iti@@ ch described a scenario that other survivors have all@@ uded to . Her ro@@ om@@ mates were taken out and divided up between those who were able to rec@@ ite verses of the Koran and those who were not . It was not clear what happened to them . She said she found some bottles of body l@@ otion where she was hiding and &quot; drank all of them , &quot; describing it as &quot; nice and lovely . &quot; But she was too scared to move . &quot; I was just praying to my God , &quot; she said . It was not until 10 : 00 on Saturday , long after the attack ended , that the authorities were able to persuade her to come out . She told AP : &quot; You know at first I did not believe it &#91; when police came to rescue her &#93; , at first I was thinking that maybe they were the al-Shabab . So I said : &apos; How do I know that you are the Kenyan police ? &apos; &quot; It was only after a member of the college staff came to convince her that it was safe to come out that she emerged .

S-127	L@@ illi@@ ard G@@ in is based at the Born in the Borders visitor centre in Jedburgh . It comes ahead of a number proposals , which are at various stages of the planning process , to open the region &apos;s first whisky distillery since 18@@ 37 . Lead distil@@ ler Kate Mac@@ in@@ nes said the potential to make the Scottish Borders a &quot; region of distil@@ ling excellence &quot; was &quot; really exciting . &quot; &quot; Our gin production is on a completely different scale to the other dis@@ till@@ eries in development , &quot; she said . &quot; Our still is one of the smallest production stil@@ ls in the UK , and our entire operation fits into a cow@@ shed , but if people like our gin , that &apos;s all that matters . &quot; We have a rich abundance of wild food on our doorstep in the T@@ evi@@ ot valley , and L@@ illi@@ ard G@@ in aims to capture that and convey a true sense of the local flavour pal@@ ette and our Borders &apos; ter@@ ro@@ ir &apos; . &quot; John Henderson , of Born in the Borders , said the gin distillery was a natural companion to the Scottish Borders Brew@@ ery on the site . &quot; To be able to play host to the first new distillery in the Borders in nearly 200 years is incredible , &quot; he said . &quot; And the fact that L@@ illi@@ ard G@@ in are looking to use Borders bot@@ an@@ icals means they are completely in tune with our own ethos of local sourcing . &quot; We just can &apos;t wait for them to get started , and to taste their gin . &quot; The gin takes its name from a legendary Borders figure . &quot; L@@ illi@@ ard was the heroine of the Battle of An@@ cru@@ m Moor in 15@@ 45 , fought just north of the distillery , &quot; explained Ms Mac@@ in@@ nes . &quot; L@@ illi@@ ard reput@@ edly fought to avenge the death of her lover at the hands of the English . The battle site is also known as L@@ illi@@ ard &apos;s Edge . &quot; We wanted a name that reflected our landscape , and our strong female production team , and L@@ illi@@ ard seemed like a natural choice . &quot;

S-180	Researchers found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home . Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home . The survey , of about 1,000 parents , found the most popular vegetables were car@@ rots , swee@@ t@@ corn and pe@@ as . Aub@@ erg@@ ine , chick@@ pe@@ as and spin@@ ach were among the least popular . Of the parents questioned , 6@@ 28 had children who ate school lunches . ( % den@@ otes proportion of parents who said their child would eat each vegetable ) England &apos;s School Food Trust commissioned the research after a survey by the Mum@@ s@@ net website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fus@@ sy to eat anything else . Trust chairman , Rob Rees , said : &quot; Every parent knows it &apos;s a nightmare watching their child push food around the plate . &quot; School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet . &quot; Mum@@ s@@ net co-founder , Carrie Long@@ ton , said : &quot; Getting children to eat healthily is every parent &apos;s dream , but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged . &quot; From Mum@@ s@@ nett@@ ers &apos; experience it seems that once at school there &apos;s a desire to fit in with everyone else and even some positive peer pressure to boast about the variety of what foods you can eat . &quot; School meals have also moved on quite a bit from when Mum@@ s@@ nett@@ ers were at school , with healthier options and more variety . &quot; School meals in England now have to comply with strict nutritional guidelines . About four in 10 primary school children in England now eat school lunches , slightly more than in secondary schools . More children in Scotland eat school lunches - about 46 % . The survey was conducted online between 26 February and 5th March among a panel of parents who had at least one child in school aged 4-@@ 17 years old .

S-409	The 76-year-old , who received the Â £ 25,000 prize for Squ@@ int ( 19 ) at Liverpool &apos;s Walker Art Gallery , was one of the shortlisted artists in 1991 . Simpson , who has also made the prize longlist on three other occasions , said finally winning was &quot; very nice indeed . &quot; Judge An@@ sel Kr@@ ut said Squ@@ int ( 19 ) was &quot; quite extraordinary , &quot; even though it was a &quot; difficult painting to look at . &quot; The work depicts a le@@ per squ@@ int , which Simpson said were &quot; holes made in the sides of medieval churches so the un@@ des@@ ir@@ ables could look through to the service and somehow take part . &quot; He said it was one of a series of paintings he has been working on , some of which were &quot; much bigger . &quot; The relatively small size of Squ@@ int ( 19 ) - which is about 7ft ( 2.1m ) in height - was one of the reasons Simpson entered it into the competition , though he also admitted that it &quot; seemed to be a good idea to send one that I was con@@ vers@@ ant with and was working with . &quot; He said the prize money would be spent on &quot; stretches , canvas and - particularly - good quality paints . &quot; &quot; I spend a lot of money on materials , so this money is going to go to a good cause . &quot; Kr@@ ut said Simpson &apos;s piece was &quot; a little bit like a tone poem - when you spend some time with it , it gradually starts to build a picture . &quot; &quot; Techn@@ ically , it &apos;s very subtle and his language is very minimal , very reduced , but when you enter into it , you get into this broad field of great sympathy , because of the subject matter . &quot; We couldn &apos;t have asked for a better painting . &quot; Establ@@ ished in 1957 , the biennial John Moores Pain@@ ting Prize is one of Britain &apos;s oldest art awards . Previous winners include David Hockney and Peter Do@@ ig . Sir Peter Blake , who is now the prize &apos;s patron , won the junior title in 1961 .

S-272	However , since 1987 racial and political tensions have been a steady source of instability and international isolation . In 1987 a coup by indigenous Fi@@ ji@@ ans overthrew the elected , Indian-@@ dominated coalition . This triggered a series of adverse events , including the introduction - and subsequent withdrawal - of a constitution en@@ shrin@@ ing indigenous Fijian political supremacy . A further coup in 2000 , led by businessman George Spe@@ ight , saw the country &apos;s first ethnic Indian prime minister , his cabinet and several MPs held hostage for several weeks . These events caused great harm to the economy - the tourism industry in particular - and Fiji &apos;s international reputation . R@@ anc@@ our over the 2000 coup persisted , with bitter divisions over plans to grant an amnesty to those behind it . The continuing tensions generated by these disputes culminated in a bloo@@ dless military takeover in 2006 - Fiji &apos;s fourth coup in 20 years . In September 2009 , Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth over its lack of progress towards democracy . It was only the second full suspension in the organisation &apos;s history . In 2012 the government agreed to hold free elections in 2014 , prompting Fiji &apos;s powerful neighbours Australia and New Zealand to restore full diplomatic ties . Following the elections the Commonwealth re-@@ inst@@ ated Fiji as a member . Fiji &apos;s population , which resid@@ es mostly on the two main islands of V@@ iti Lev@@ u and Van@@ ua Lev@@ u , is divided between indigenous Fi@@ ji@@ ans and In@@ do-@@ Fi@@ ji@@ ans , the descend@@ ents of ind@@ ent@@ ured labourers brought from India . The two groups were of roughly equal numbers until the mid-@@ 2000s , by which time coups and ag@@ itation had prompted thousands of In@@ do-@@ Fi@@ ji@@ ans to flee . Indigenous Fi@@ ji@@ ans now make up small overall majority . Mi@@ xing between the two groups is minimal , and informal segregation runs deep at almost every level of society . There are also very small non-@@ In@@ do-@@ Fijian , non-@@ Fijian minority communities , such as Chinese and Rot@@ u@@ mans . Although the former British colony relies heavily on the sugar and tourism industries for its foreign exchange , its economy is diverse . Gold , silver and limestone are mined , and there is a strong services sector and some light manufacturing . Nonetheless , Fiji has been hampered by persistent trade and budget deficits , making it one of the world &apos;s largest per capita recipients of aid .

S-224	Mohammad Th@@ ne@@ ib@@ at said countries such as Jordan faced a &quot; serious problem &quot; in coping with so many young refugees . He called for more international financial support to help build schools and train teachers . &quot; The alternatives are very bad , &quot; said Mr Th@@ ne@@ ib@@ at . &quot; The international community will pay a high price if we don &apos;t stand together to face this serious problem , &quot; he told the Global Education and Skills Forum . Mr Th@@ ne@@ ib@@ at said Jordan already had Palestinian and Iraqi refugees and now had 1.3 million Syrians who had fled across its borders . &quot; We &apos;re trying to do everything to educate these young people for peace , introducing ideas of tolerance and co-@@ existence , &quot; Mr Th@@ ne@@ ib@@ at , who is also Jordan &apos;s education minister , told the international conference in Dubai . But he warned that Syria &apos;s neighbours did not have the capacity to deal with such an influx of families without more international assistance . He said Jordan was training thousands more teachers and building new schools , which would operate in double shifts to try to accommodate 14@@ 5,000 refugee children in its state school system . But there were still more children arriving than could be taught , he warned . There had been financial support from the international community - and more had been pledged , Mr Th@@ ne@@ ib@@ at said - but almost two-thirds of the cost of each extra refugee pupil was being taken from Jordan &apos;s own education budget , he said . This was in addition to extra costs in health , housing and infrastructure . Without any access to education , he said such youngsters could become part of another cycle of conflict . &quot; If we leave these students , we believe they could become extremists . &quot; Tom Fletcher , UK ambassador to Lebanon until last year , said the numbers of refugees were now &quot; staggering . &quot; Mr Fletcher is now working for a coalition trying to get business support to tackle the refugee crisis . He said conventional humanitarian crisis approaches did not work on this scale , and that other groups , including business , should contribute . George Pap@@ en@@ dre@@ ou , former prime minister of Greece , told the conference that he had been a refugee when his family was in political exile . He said that European countries should try to see refugees as potential benefits to their societies rather than respond with &quot; fear and ignorance . &quot;

S-245	Met Police barrister Richard Hor@@ well QC said suspects Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoi had no personal motive to kill . The Russian state &quot; is likely to have been the sponsor of this plot &quot; and had &quot; reasons ap@@ lenty &quot; for wishing him &quot; not only harm , but death , &quot; he said . UK officials believe the two suspects poisoned Mr Litvinenko , 43 , in London in 2006 but they deny any wrongdoing . Mr Litvinenko drank tea containing a fatal dose of radioactive substance pol@@ oni@@ um-@@ 210 during a meeting with Mr Kovtun and Mr Lugovoi . He died in hospital nearly three weeks later . The fact that pol@@ onium caused his death indicates there was some form of Russian state participation , Mr Hor@@ well said in his closing remarks . He said : &quot; The evidence suggests the only credible explanation is that in one form or another the Russian state was involved in Mr Litvinenko &apos;s murder . &quot; However , he stressed this did not mean Russian President Vladimir Putin was involved or gave the order and that there were many possible motives for the murder . Def@@ ecting to the UK in 2000 , after accusing KGB successor the FSB of murdering political opponents and of corruption , could have been seen as &quot; akin to treach@@ ery , &quot; he said . He also spoke of Mr Litvinenko &apos;s &quot; many personal attacks on Putin . &quot; Mr Hor@@ well has said the risk to the general public in London from pol@@ onium radiation will never be known , and also that Mr Litvinenko had been poisoned twice in the run-up to his death . He said : &quot; The two attacks on Mr Litvinenko were an outrage . They led to great suffering on his part and eventually to his demise . &quot; We will never know how dangerous the exposure of pol@@ onium to the public at large will be and what long-term effects will be visited upon Londoners . &quot; Mr Hor@@ well said the suspects left a &quot; trail of pol@@ onium &quot; behind and they had &quot; no credible answer &quot; to the scientific evidence against them . While the force wanted them tried for murder , this was now unlikely to happen , the inquiry heard . Attempts to extradite the two men have failed and they remain in Russia . Former Soviet army officer Mr Kovtun has been criticised by inquiry chairman Sir Robert Owen for failing to give evidence to the hearing . The inquiry was adjourned until Friday .

S-53	The animal had been shot twice in the shoulder and once in its left back leg , which vets had to amput@@ ate . The charity said the one-year-old cat was &quot; incredibly lucky &quot; to survive . Last year the Scottish government held a consultation on licensing air weapons , but a majority of responders opposed the plan . One@@ -year-old Teen@@ ie was found injured by her owner Sarah Nis@@ bett in N@@ id@@ dry@@ View , Win@@ ch@@ burgh , at about 16 : 30 on Friday 14 March and taken to the Scottish SPCA . Mrs Nis@@ bett said the cat was now having to learn how to walk again . &quot; The gun that was used must have some power because the pellet actually went through her back leg , that &apos;s why it was so badly damaged , &quot; she said . &quot; She &apos;s now learning how to hop around the house , it &apos;s terrible . &quot; The fact that it was three shots is crazy . We live in a housing estate and there are lots of kids . That just makes it worse because any of them could have been hit in the crossfire . &quot; She added : &quot; There &apos;s some sick people out there , hopefully somebody will know who &apos;s done this and let the police or the Scottish SPCA know . &quot; Scottish SPCA Ch Supt Mike Flynn said : &quot; Teen@@ ie &apos;s owners are understandably very upset and keen for us to find the callous person responsible to ensure no more cats come to harm . &quot; This is an alarming incident which only highlights why the Scottish government should implement the licensing of air@@ guns as a matter of urgency . &quot; He added : &quot; The new licensing regime should ensure that only those with a lawful reason are allowed to possess such a dangerous weapon . It will also help the police trace anyone using an air gun ir@@ responsibly . &quot; Last year the Scottish government launched a consultation on licensing air weapons , with a large majority of those who responded opposing the plan . Under the proposed scheme , anyone wanting to own an air gun would need to demonstrate they had a legitimate reason for doing so . A total of 87 % of respondents rejected the idea - with some describing it as &quot; draconian &quot; and &quot; heavy-handed . &quot; A small number of people felt ministers were not going far enough . The Scottish SPCA urged anyone with information about the incident to contact them .

S-10	The exhibition Growing Up in the City at the Museum of Liverpool boasts 25 ev@@ oc@@ ative photographs which capture the life of children over more than 100 years . As well as a providing a snapshot of those lost days of childhood , the pictures also provide a though@@ t-@@ provoking social history of life in Liverpool through the decades . The photographs span the period from the 18@@ 80s to the 1990s and illustrate just how much life for a child has changed and also how special occasions were marked on the city &apos;s streets . The oldest image dates back to 18@@ 87 and is a portrait of Florence , George and Ger@@ tie Rol@@ lo , who came from Waterloo Park . The Rol@@ lo family lived in a large home in the area called Stone House and had four servants . The picture shows the children dressed up in costumes for a fancy dress ball hosted by the Mayor and May@@ o@@ ress of Bootle , Alder@@ man and Mrs Howard . As well as showing children at play , another image reminds us that many youngsters were also sent out to work . A nervous looking young maid for a well-@@ to-@@ do Liverpool family is captured in a great portrait which is thought to have been taken about 1900 . The exhibition has been put together by Kay Jones , Cur@@ ator of Urban Community History at the Museum of Liverpool . Ms Jones painstakingly traw@@ led through hundreds of images from the National Museums Liverpool &apos;s collections before deciding on the final 25 for the exhibition . She said : &quot; This has been a fascinating exhibition to work on . &quot; Looking through hundreds of different post@@ cards , photographs and glass plate negatives in our collections ; it was hard to decide on the final 25 images . &quot; I chose the ones that really stood out and told the experience of childhood . &quot; People love seeing old photographs and most people can relate to the same experiences of playing out in the street if they &apos;re from Liverpool or anywhere else . &quot; But , at the same time , the pictures also remind us of how things have changed . &quot; I didn &apos;t want it to be just happy memories , I also wanted to remember the children who had to work throughout their childhood . &quot; I wanted it to be the good and bad experiences of childhood . &quot; Growing Up in the City is at the Museum of Liverpool until 25 September .

The aim is to provide additional space to accommodate a 25 % increase in student numbers by 2018 .

Mr Mundell said : &quot; It is a real pleasure to host tonight &apos;s fundraising event for the Mackintosh Campus , and to support the rebuilding of an iconic British institution which has produced so many leading architects , designers and artists . &quot; Professor Tom In@@ ns , director of GSA , added : &quot; It is an important opportunity for us to share our ambitious plans for the campus redevelopment , including bringing together all pathways of the School of Fine Art for the first time in many years in a refurbished Sto@@ w Building , and to give an update on the restoration of the Mackintosh Building . &quot; After the Mackintosh building blaze , an investigation by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service concluded it was caused by flammable gases from a canister of expanding foam . The report said the gases ignited as they came into contact with the hot surface of a proj@@ ector .

S-165	Media playback is not supported on this device The American , 32 , looked set to take part after warming up on the range but he then withdrew on the first tee . The US Open champion fell on the stairs and hurt his lower back on Wednesday . &quot; I &apos;m playing the best golf of my life and to have a freak accident happen yesterday afternoon , it su@@ cks really bad , &quot; said Johnson . &quot; I have been worked on all morning and obviously I can take some swings , but I can &apos;t swing full , I can &apos;t make my normal swing and I didn &apos;t think there was any chance I could compete . &quot; The 15-@@ time PGA Tour winner added : &quot; I was wearing socks and slipped and went down the three stairs . The left side of my lower back took the brunt of it and my left elbow is bruised as well . &quot; Johnson &apos;s caddie was placing the ball on his tee for him on the range , while coach But@@ ch Har@@ mon said pain hindered Johnson &apos;s rest overnight . Shortly before his withdrawal , he progressed from hitting wedge shots on the range to fuller swings and his involvement looked likely as he made his way to the first tee for a scheduled 19 : 03 BST start alongside playing partners Bubba Watson and Jimmy Walker . Johnson was a popular pick to win the first major of the year as a result of the fine form he has shown in 2017 . He has won the past three tournaments in which he has competed - February &apos;s Genesis Open , and both the WGC Mexico Championship and WGC Dell Match Play in March . As well as winning last year &apos;s US Open by four shots , he finished ninth at the Open Championship and tied fourth at the Masters . BBC Radio 5 live correspondent Iain Carter Johnson took until the very last second to make what must have been an agonising decision to pull out . He was standing on the first tee before making the toughest call of his career . It is a severe blow for the player who has dominated golf this season . He arrived here off the back of three big victories and was a justifiable favourite . All that has been lost through his freak fall at his rental home and the damage done to his back .

S-9	Earlier this month , NRW estimated the lagoon would mean 21 % of salmon and 25 % of sea trout dying each year , as they migrate to and from local rivers . Tidal Lagoon Power ( T@@ LP ) said the claims had no &quot; clear scientific basis . &quot; NRW said its figures were based on the &quot; best available evidence &quot; it received . In a briefing note sent to AMs and seen by BBC Wales , T@@ LP disputed NRW &apos;s figures and claimed that the regulator refused to share its methodology for calculating them . &quot; Without clear scientific basis NRW has recently published figures based in these &apos; what if &apos; scenarios despite our request to consider the evidence needed to back them up prior to publication , &quot; the briefing said . &quot; These scenarios give unrealistic and grossly misleading impact figures &#91; on fish &#93; , &quot; the briefing adds . T@@ LP said that computer modelling carried out by experts on its behalf estimated a &quot; worst case scenario &quot; of the lagoon killing 2 % of all species of fish . The Â £ 1.3bn Swansea tidal lagoon project is being viewed by the firm as a test bed for much larger and more cost effective versions around the coast , including Cardiff , Newport and Colwyn Bay . UK government ministers are considering the findings of a six-month review of the viability of the scheme , which is yet to be published . Wales &apos; Environment Secretary Lesley Griffiths said the Welsh Government was &quot; very supportive &quot; of the scheme . But she said both it and the industry needed clarity on the UK government &apos;s position in the &quot; very , very near future . &quot; NRW said it strongly disagreed with T@@ LP &apos;s criticism , which it was &quot; very surprised and disappointed by . &quot; Gareth O &apos;Shea , an NRW executive director , said : &quot; We have received a vast amount of evidence on this subject from the applicant and have held detailed discussions with the developer for a year-@@ and-a-half where we have shared a huge amount of information , data and our methodology . &quot; This has been assessed by independent experts and our own technical experts , and we have the utmost confidence that it is the best evidence available to enable us to make the right decision for the environment in Wales , as we are legally bound to do . &quot;

S-491	The boy is from Northern Ireland , but his family do not want him to be named to protect his identity . His mother had to give up her job to look after him . In June , his parents made the difficult decision to remove him from mainstream schooling because he was not coping . They requested a place for him at a special school but are still waiting . In September , the family was told that all the special schools in the South Eastern Education Board area were full to capacity and no time frame could be given as to when a place would become available . The boy &apos;s mother told the BBC &apos;s Good Morning Ulster programme that her son does not understand why his brother and sister are able to go to school but he is not . &quot; He really misses being around people , he doesn &apos;t like being isolated , but unfortunately the way the system has been working so far has actually worked to isolate him more , &quot; she said . The family has now been told that an extra classroom assistant has been employed at a local special school and the hope is that their son will be able to start there in the next few weeks . However , the boy &apos;s mother is worried that this same situation will happen to other families as the special needs school system is packed to capacity . &quot; The schools are being put in the position where they have a family like us who desperately require a place in the school , but they really have no capacity there because the school is already over-@@ subscribed . &quot; The BBC asked the Education Authority for a response to the concerns the family has raised but its spokesperson said they could not comment on individual cases . &quot; As we have a duty to protect the privacy rights of the child , it would be unacceptable to publicly discuss their specific and highly sensitive needs , &quot; they said . In relation to special school provision in general , they said the Education Authority was &quot; currently reviewing the profile of need for special school places in Northern Ireland and is endeav@@ ouring to ensure that places are available close to where the children reside . &quot; &quot; This work is ongoing and is designed to assist with the placement of children with effect from 2016 , &quot; the spokesperson added .

S-286	Home Retail Group said that like-for-like sales at Argos fell 1.1 % in the eight weeks to 27 February , compared to a fall of 2.2 % in the previous quarter . The electrical and hom@@ ew@@ are retailer is being targeted by both Sainsbury &apos;s and South African retailer Stein@@ hoff . Both companies have until 18 March to make firm bids for Argos . Last month , a £ 1.3bn bid from Sainsbury &apos;s for Home Retail was tr@@ umped by Stein@@ hoff &apos;s £ 1.4bn offer . Home Retail recently sold its DIY chain Hom@@ eb@@ ase to Australia &apos;s Wes@@ farmers last month for £ 3@@ 40m , leaving Argos as its only remaining business . Total sales at Argos rose 1.9 % to £ 5@@ 15m in the eight-week period as demand for furniture and sports goods offset lower sales of electrical goods , such as video games and tablet computers . The company said Argos opened 90 new stores over the year , bringing the total to 8@@ 45 . The new openings held back the like-for-like sales total over the period , it added . Chief executive John Walden , who said it had been &quot; another rather eventful period &quot; for the company , was pleased with the improvement in Argos &apos; sales . Shares in Home Retail closed down almost 0.5 % at 17@@ 9.@@ 1p , but have risen more than 80 % this year following Sainsbury &apos;s interest in Argos . The supermarket has argued that combining both chains would create a &quot; world-leading &quot; retailer bigger than rivals John Lewis and Amazon UK . Retail analyst Nick Bub@@ b said : &quot; Home Retail claim that underlying like-for-like sales were broadly flat , once the canni@@ bal@@ isation from the infamous concession inser@@ ts in Hom@@ eb@@ ase and Sainsbury are taken out . Gross margins were up , however , by 75 basis points and Home Retail &apos;s year-@@ end net cash was strong . &quot; Sainsbury &apos;s had offered about 16@@ 7@@ p a share for Home Retail , but will be forced to at least match the 17@@ 5@@ p-@@ a-@@ share all-@@ cash offer from Stein@@ hoff , which owns UK furniture retailer Har@@ ve@@ ys . However , the supermarket may be reluctant to increase its offer to the level needed to win control of Argos . Analysts have also questioned the wisdom of Sainsbury &apos;s acquiring the struggling retailer .

S-400	They believe ministers are placing too much emphasis on the environment at the expense of trees grown for timber . Britain is currently the world &apos;s third largest im@@ porter of wood . Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation . Con@@ i@@ fer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow . But Con@@ for , which promotes the forestry industry , warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-@@ planted to meet needs . Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies . As an industry , it is estimated to be worth more than Â £ 450m a year to the Welsh economy . But there is a conflict with environmental policy . Succ@@ essive ministers have wanted more native , broad@@ leaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife . However , some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents . The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental , the economic and the social in how forestry is developed . It points to its Glas@@ tir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland . It said its Wood@@ lands for Wales forestry strategy &quot; sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape , provide real social and community benefits , support thriving wood@@ land-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment . &quot; Martin Bishop , of Con@@ for , which represents 200 businesses in Wales , believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as &quot; sex@@ ier &quot; than commercial forestry . He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas . Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20,000 hectares a year to meet long-term targets set by ministers . &quot; There &apos;s a huge market for our timber . Every saw mill@@ er tells me he would double or treble production if the timber was there to feed that mill , &quot; he added .

S-451	Gatland won a first clean sweep in his maiden Six Nations as coach in 2008 after Wales &apos; disappointing 2007 World Cup display . He guided Wales to a second Grand Slam in 2012 after narrowly missing out on the 2011 World Cup final . &quot; We were disappointed not getting to the final in 2011 , &quot; he said . &quot; We feel a little bit the same this time around . &quot; There &apos;s a little bit of frustration as we felt we could have gone a bit further in the World Cup , although we were proud of what we achieved given the number of injuries we had . &quot; Wales qualified alongside Australia from their World Cup pool despite a host of injuries to key players such as Leigh Halfpenny , Jonathan Davies and Rhys Webb . Wales were knocked out of the World Cup by two-time champions South Africa in the quarter-final despite leading with 10 minutes remaining . Webb and Halfpenny are still out injured , but centre Davies has returned while backs Liam Williams and Hallam Amos are returning to fitness . Wales hold the record of Championship victories - 26 outright and 12 shared - and a third Grand Slam in nine years would mean they join England on a record 12 Grand Slams . Media playback is not supported on this device Ireland are bidding to become the first side ever to win the Championship three times in a row and Wales coach Gatland said : &quot; You can &apos;t look past the Irish . &quot; The New Zealander also said that England under new coach Eddie Jones are an &quot; unknown quantity &quot; in &quot; a really open competition . &quot; Wales begin their Six Nations bid against the defending champions in Dublin - the same venue where the Welsh began their 2012 Grand Slam campaign . &quot; We &apos;re in pretty good shape , &quot; added Gatland , himself a former Ireland coach . &quot; There &apos;s a few new coaches this year and the famili@@ arly will help us put things together quickly . &quot; Our time together at the World Cup is invaluable preparation and potentially a slight advantage . &quot; It is massive that we &apos;re going away to Dublin first and if we can win that first game , the next game at home against Scotland is six days later . &quot; Momentum is huge in this competition . &quot;

S-59	The views were expressed following a meeting of the EU Negoti@@ ation Joint Ministerial Committee in London . Mr Davis said the UK government would keep Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland up-to-date about negotiations . However , Mr Russell said transparency about UK government plans was needed . Mr Davis said he wanted to hold a monthly meeting to share analysis as part of a &quot; two-way information flow &quot; with each of the three nations . He believed that would allow the devolved administrations to voice their views as the Westminster government prepares talks with Brussels . Mr Davis said : &quot; Today &apos;s meeting was an important step in bringing the devolved administrations together with the UK government to discuss how we can work together to get the best deal for the whole of the UK . &quot; Naturally , there are different stand@@ points around the table , but the meeting was constructive and amicable . We will meet regularly and share our latest thinking as the UK shapes its negotiating strategy . &quot; We will work positively with the Scottish government , the Welsh government and the Northern Ireland Executive as we implement the decision of the people of the UK to leave the EU . &quot; Mr Russell said it was &quot; good &quot; that the process of involving the Scottish government was under way . But he added : &quot; More than four months after the referendum the UK government has still not made its strategic intentions clear . &quot; There was a discussion over EU market access but we do not know whether UK ministers want to remain inside the single market or the customs union . This will remain a considerable problem as we continue to promote the interests of Scotland . &quot; The UK Government must provide greater clarity and transparency on its intentions . &quot; He said he made it &quot; absolutely clear &quot; that membership of the single market &quot; is essential for the economic prosperity of Scotland . &quot; The UK government hopes the High Court judgment on how Article 50 will be triggered will be overruled on appeal to the Supreme Court next month . However , the Scottish government will seek to oppose the UK government in the Supreme Court during the appeal . The intention is for Lord Advocate James Wol@@ ffe , Scotland &apos;s most senior law officer , to apply to be heard in the case .

S-221	Jocelyn McKay is now 81 and said she feels &quot; released &quot; from the feelings that gripped her for so long . &quot; I may be old , but at least I am happy , &quot; she told BBC News NI . &quot; I hadn &apos;t really lived until I got the operation . &quot; For years I felt I was in the wrong body and it wasn &apos;t until I was 69 that I plucked up the courage to ask for help . &quot; It was only after a trip to Manchester with some friends , during which Ms McKay lived as a woman , that she realised the surgery was something she needed . &quot; I was a cross-@@ dres@@ ser , I went away dressed as a man and I came home dressed as a man , but in between times I was a woman , &quot; she said . But cross-@@ dressing was not good enough for her . When Ms McKay returned from her trip , she visited her GP , who referred her to a specialist . She said : &quot; I had been going to the doctor for a range of ailments and he said to me : &apos; Thank God you &apos;ve finally told me what &apos;s wrong . &apos; &quot; Every week three or four people present themselves as transgender to the Regional Gender Id@@ entity and Psy@@ chos@@ exual Service at Knock@@ brack@@ en in Belfast . They typically make contact with the clinic through a GP referral or a drop-in facility every week . 200 people are currently being treated by the clinic with 50 more on the waiting list . More than half of them are aged between 18 and 25 . The number of adults going to the clinic is doubling year on year . The clinic provides adults with assessment , psychological support and onward referral for hormone replacement therapy and surgery where appropriate . A gender identity panel to strategically look at the issues facing transgender people met for the first time at Stormont on Monday . It was formed by the peer support group Focus - The Id@@ entity Trust . It comprises politicians from Sinn FÃ © in and the Alliance party , as well as a Presbyterian minister , the Reverend Lesley Carroll , and others with a long-standing interest in human rights . The Sinn FÃ © in minister Megan Fear@@ on said the gathering was about &quot; bringing marginalised people together , giving them space to discuss transgender issues and engaging with politicians in a way that had not been done before . &quot; &quot; Transgender people still experience discrimination in nearly every walk of life , &quot; she said . The panel will address trans-@@ phob@@ ic hate crime and access to health and education .

S-312	It works by looking for a combination of &quot; markers &quot; in the blood which are different in healthy people and those with the disease . Delegates at the Alzheimer &apos;s Research UK Conference heard that the University of Nottingham is now developing a quick and easy test to do in clinics . It could mean much earlier diagnosis and better treatments , they said . The test uses some proteins that have been strongly linked with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , such as am@@ y@@ lo@@ id and AP@@ OE . But through careful analysis of blood from people with the disease , as well as those with early-@@ stage memory problems , the researchers detected some other markers that were sugg@@ estive of the disease . Most notably , some proteins related to inflammation seem to have been added to increase the power of the test . Prof Kevin Morgan from the University of Nottingham said they still had to valid@@ ate the test and it could be a decade before it was used in patients . But he added that the combination of markers they had found was looking very promising . &quot; Our findings are exciting because they show that it is technically possible to distinguish between healthy people and those with Alzheimer &apos;s using a blood test . &quot; As blood tests are a fast and easy way of aiding diagnosis , we are really encouraged by these findings and the potential they hold for the future . &quot; He said there were several ways the test could benefit patients , including giving people a definitive diagnosis , which was not always possible at the moment . It could also direct future therapies to make sure patients were getting the most appropriate treatment , he explained . Pot@@ entially , it could be a &quot; cheap and easy pre-@@ screen &quot; test which enabled Alzheimer &apos;s to be picked up before symptoms appeared , he said . &quot; The way we see it working is you can test people and it will tell them if they have the all-clear , or if they are medi@@ um@@ - or high-risk . &quot; If they are medium-@@ risk , they can be monitored closely and high-risk patients can be referred to a specialist for more in-depth testing . &quot; Dr Eric Kar@@ ran , director of Research at Alzheimer &apos;s Research UK , said : &quot; Giving people with dementia an accurate diagnosis is not always easy , and so building up our arm@@ oury of diagnostic techniques is vital . &quot; While there is still some way to go before a test like this could become available , the results are promising . &quot; When used alongside other diagnostic techniques , a blood test like this could be a real help . &quot;

S-106	The latest threats bring the number of incidents to 69 in 27 states in the past month , according to the J@@ CC Association of North America . No bombs were found at any of the centres targeted with telephone calls . Last week , 27 Jewish community centres in 17 US states reported receiving hoax bomb threats . All of the threats made on Monday , along with previous incidents in January , turned out to be false and Jewish centres have since reopened with normal services resumed . Responding to the latest incidents , White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that US President Donald Trump had made it &quot; abundantly clear &quot; that such actions were &quot; unacceptable . &quot; &quot; Hat@@ red and ha@@ te-@@ motivated violence of any kind have no place in a country founded on the promise of individual freedom , &quot; the statement , which was shared on Twitter by NBC News correspondent Peter Alexander , said . Mr Trump &apos;s daughter Ivanka - who has converted to Judaism and whose husband is Jewish - also condemned the threats . Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said that action must be taken to prevent further incidents . In a post on Twitter , Mrs Clinton wrote : &quot; J@@ CC threats , cemetery desec@@ ration and online attacks are so troubling and they need to be stopped . Everyone must speak out , starting w / @ PO@@ T@@ US . &quot; The threats were made to the Jewish community centres through calls that were both pre-@@ recorded and live , with suspects using voice-@@ disgu@@ ising technology , according to Israeli newspaper Ha@@ are@@ tz . Since the beginning of the year , there have been reports of threats to centres in New York , New Jersey , Ohio , Florida , Massachusetts , Maryland , Michigan , Minnesota , Delaware , Connecticut , Alabama , California , Maine , Tennessee , South Carolina , Missouri , Wisconsin , Texas and Kansas . The J@@ CC Association of North America , a network of health and education centres , has since been reviewing its security plans . In an earlier statement the FBI said that along with the US justice department it was investigating possible civil rights violations in connection with the threats . The Anti-@@ Def@@ amation League , a Jewish anti-@@ bigotry organisation , said in a statement that it was &quot; deeply disturbed &quot; by the latest threats to the Jewish community . Meanwhile , more than 100 head@@ stones have been damaged at a Jewish cemetery in St Louis , Missouri , local media report . In the Canadian city of Toronto , Mayor John Tory has condemned anti-Semitic hate notes left outside the homes of Jewish residents .

S-262	He was seriously injured in a bomb attack in Afghanistan in 2006 . Since carrying the torch on 26 June , Don@@ cast@@ er@@ -based L / B@@ dr Parkinson has had thousands of requests on Facebook . But the site limits friend associations to 5,000 per personal page and he cannot accept all the requests . Flan@@ ked by hundreds of people , he walked for nearly half an hour with the Olympic torch with an assistant who supported his arm . L / B@@ dr Parkinson &apos;s nomination stated : &quot; The brain injury took his speech , but not his personality and sense of humour , &quot; adding he now speaks un@@ aided . It said : &quot; De@@ termin@@ ed to prove everyone wrong , he fought back every step of the way . Ben &apos;s intelligence and wit &#91; are &#93; unchanged . Still the same funny and caring Ben . &quot; He spends 12 hours a day in the gym and rehab and walks with crutches , spending &quot; the rest of his time spent raising money for many military charities and as patron of his beloved Pilgrim Band@@ its . &quot; L / B@@ dr Parkinson &apos;s mother Diane said the responses had &quot; been phenomenal &quot; and that Ben was really &quot; buoyed up &quot; by the support and friendship he had been shown . She said : &quot; It &apos;s just unbelievable , Ben &apos;s had way over 5,000 friend requests but Facebook won &apos;t let him have more than that number . &quot; Thousands of people have joined the Pilgrim Band@@ its website and the messages of support we &apos;ve had are great . &quot; Ben &apos;s page has had 19,000 hits just on an update , I don &apos;t understand how these things work , but it &apos;s phenomenal . &quot; She said the amount of post the family had received had also increased . She added : &quot; Some mail has just been addressed to Ben , please Mr Pos@@ tie . &quot; E-@@ mail traffic has gone through the roof and Ben &apos;s had hundreds of requests to visit places with the &#91; Olympic &#93; torch . &quot; He &apos;s absolutely bouncing and buoyed up and elated . &quot; Facebook would not comment on the issue but their guidance was that if people were receiving this many requests then they have become a public figure , so should consider having a page instead of a profile . Alternatively , Ben could use subscribe so that people can see his public updates without actually becoming a friend . A total of 8,000 people will carry the flame during its 8,000 mile , 70-@@ day journey to the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London on 27 July .

S-61	He is appealing against an appeal court ruling lifting a ban on him being named in the media in England and Wales . The Supreme Court said it will now hear arguments about whether it should grant an appeal , and if so , decide if it should be &quot; allowed or dismissed . &quot; An interim injunction will remain in place until the end of the hearing . On Monday , Court of Appeal judges gave the man - who has young children , and whose spouse is also in the public eye - until 10 : 00 BST on Tuesday to apply to take the case to the UK Supreme Court . In that ruling , they said there must be no publication leading to disclosure of the celebrity &apos;s identity before 13 : 00 BST on Wednesday . The Supreme Court said that interim injunction will now remain in place until the conclusion of the next hearing . The Sun on Sunday wants to publish an account of alleged extra-@@ marital activities by the man , who is referred to as P@@ JS . But he argues he has a right to privacy and has taken legal action . Monday &apos;s court judgement said the celebrity had &quot; occasional sexual encounters &quot; with another person - referred to in court as AB - starting in 2009 . They had a text message exchange in December 2011 in which they discussed a &quot; three-way &quot; with AB &apos;s partner , CD . Accor@@ dingly , the three met for a three-way sexual encounter . In January , the two other parties approached the Sun On Sunday with the story . That month a High Court judge refused to impose an injunction barring publication . But the man appealed and two appeal court judges ruled in his favour . They prevented him being identified in publications in England and Wales . Lawyers for News Group Newspapers - publishers of the Sun On Sunday - then asked Court of Appeal judges to lift the ban . They argued that stories had been published in the US , Scotland and elsewhere where the injunction does not apply . The story had also spread across the internet and on Twitter . P@@ JS opposed that application and said the ban should stay . On Monday , the judges ruled that P@@ JS was now unlikely to be able to get a permanent injunction Details about the allegations were now &quot; so widespread &quot; that confidentiality had &quot; probably been lost , &quot; they said . The man &apos;s solicitors had been &quot; as@@ sid@@ uous &quot; in monitoring the internet and removing stories in breach of the injunction but the judges said that it was now a &quot; hopeless task . &quot;

S-58	Now the complete ban is being lifted . Until now , any man who had ever had sex with another man was barred for life from donation . From 7 November the ban is being lifted in England , Scotland and Wales . But men who want to donate must not have had sex with another man in the past 12 months . This def@@ erral period has been left in place because there is a &quot; window period &quot; after infection with blood-@@ borne viruses where they are not det@@ ectable . This window period is far less than 12 months . The report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood , T@@ issues and Org@@ ans ( Sa@@ BT@@ O ) says that for HIV it varies from nine to 15 days , depending on the type of test . For hepatitis B , which causes liver disease , it is 66 days . In Spain , the def@@ erral period is six months following the change of a sexual partner , whether the would-be donor is heterosexual or gay . In Italy the restriction lasts for four months following the change of partner . By contrast , in the US , Canada , France and many other countries there is a complete ban on donations from men who have ever had sex with men . Whilst welcoming the lifting of the ban in the UK , some still regard the one year def@@ erral as too long . Stonewall Chief Executive Ben Summer@@ skill . &quot; To retain a blanket ban on any man who has had sex with another man in the last year , even if he has only had oral sex , remains disproportionate on the basis of available evidence . &quot; But Sir Nick Partridge , Chief Executive of Ter@@ rence Higgins Trust said : &quot; The remaining def@@ erral regulation for sexually active gay men is based on their heightened risk , as a group , of sexually acquired blood-@@ borne viruses . &quot; A one year def@@ erral period for donation applies to other groups as well : for example anyone who has been sexually active in countries where HIV / Aids is very common , and anyone who has had sex with a prostitute . NHS Blood and Transplant has a complete list of who can and cannot donate . The hope will be that the shift in policy will lead to an increase in the number of donors . If you want more detail about the reasoning behind the decision to lift the ban , then the full report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood , T@@ issues and Org@@ ans ( Sa@@ BT@@ O ) can be read here .

S-359	Curtis and assistant manager Paul Williams will take charge of Saturday &apos;s match against Bournemouth after Bob Bradley &apos;s sacking . Swansea want to appoint their new boss as soon as possible , with ex-@@ Derby manager Paul Clement the first choice . &quot; We &apos;ve got to go with somebody who will to get us out of trouble , &quot; he said . &quot; If we were to go down - and there &apos;s obviously that possibility - you look at the Championship and it seems to have got a lot stronger . It &apos;s not a foregone conclusion &#91; to go straight back up &#93; . &quot; I know Norwich and Burnley have done it but it &apos;s difficult . Newcastle look like they &apos;ll do it but they &apos;re a big , powerful club who can hang on to a lot of their top players . I &apos;m not sure we &apos;d be able to do that . &quot; If we go down , it &apos;s going to be tough to get back . &quot; Swansea were promoted to the Premier League in 2011 and quickly established a reputation as a well-@@ run club with a team that played exciting , poss@@ es@@ si@@ on-based football . Their promotion capped a remarkable rise from the brink of bankruptcy a decade earlier and almost being relegated out of the Football League altogether in 2003 . Curtis - a former player who was at the club throughout their rise up the divisions - believes the Swans have not been the same since Michael Lau@@ dru@@ p left in 2014 . &quot; I think we have &#91; lost our way &#93; . It &apos;s just the change of management all the time , &quot; Curtis added . &quot; The best eras were Roberto Martinez , Brendan Rodgers and Michael Lau@@ dru@@ p . But we &apos;ve probably lost a bit of the &apos; Swansea Way &apos; . It has been diluted . &quot; We &apos;ve lost quite a few players too but have we adequately replaced them ? &quot; Media playback is not supported on this device Curtis believes the current Swansea squad is good enough to stay up , and the 62-year-old reminds every new signing of how far the club has come . &quot; I know a lot of the foreign boys have seen &#91; the documentary &#93; Jack to a King . So they &apos;ve got a brief history of where we were and where we are now , &quot; he said . &quot; They might not be 100 % passionate about it but they know where we came from and how important it is &#91; to stay up &#93; . Not just for the club but for the whole area . &quot;

S-222	The Daggers , who reached League One in 2010 , needed victory to keep their slim survival hopes alive . Goals from Jamie Cu@@ re@@ ton and Clev@@ id Di@@ k@@ am@@ ona gave them hope after Jay Simpson fired the O &apos;s into a 2-0 lead . But Armand Gnanduillet fired in the winner to releg@@ ate Dagenham and keep Orient &apos;s play-off hopes alive . Dagenham reached the Football League for the first time in their history in 2007 , but they now return to the National League under John Still , the same manager who took the club from the Conference to League One . The Daggers have League Two &apos;s worst goal difference , and have conceded 20 goals more this season than they had at this point last term . Still &apos;s side have also struggled in attack , with 40-year-old striker Jamie Cu@@ re@@ ton netting nine goals , compared to the 20 he scored as Dagenham finished 14th in the 2014-15 campaign . Boss Still , who returned for his third spell at the club in December , told BBC Radio London on Wednesday that he is committed to helping the Daggers gain promotion from the National League next season . Victory leaves Orient two points adrift of the play-off spots and comes four days after player-manager Kevin Nolan was removed from his managerial role . Leyton Orient interim manager Andy Hessenthaler told BBC Radio London : Media playback is not supported on this device &quot; For me to lose two managers this season has been very tough and I &apos;ve found it very hard this week . &quot; We had to be professional , we &apos;re here to do a job and if I wasn &apos;t professional then I wouldn &apos;t be true to myself . &quot; We owe it to the fans . At the end of the day there &apos;s nobody bigger than the football club - the fans are the biggest part of the football club . &quot; We made it a little bit nervy because we gave two sloppy goals away , but in the end that &apos;s what we need to do now - we need to win games if we &apos;re going to get into the play-offs . &quot; Dagenham &amp; Redbridge manager John Still told BBC Radio London : &quot; I think for half an hour in the first half we lacked organisation and lacked discipline . &quot; If you haven &apos;t got organisation and you haven &apos;t got the discipline to play 90 minutes , the outcome is inevitable . &quot; Dagenham over the years are going to get beat , it &apos;s responding to that that the club &apos;s not been able to do this year . &quot;

S-76	Management body NHS Employers has given the plan the green light after advisers said there were a range of extra tasks they could do with more training . A Nuffield Trust review found examples of nurses filling in for hospital doctors and pharmacists for GPs . But unions warned against using it as a quick fix for problems in the NHS . It has been well documented that there are gaps in junior doctor rot@@ as , while GPs are struggling to cope with the rising number of patients coming through their doors . NHS Employers asked the Nuffield Trust to look at ways the 1.3 million-@@ strong workforce could be reshap@@ ed to help . The think tank highlighted examples of areas that were already experimenting . These included : The report said as well as helping cover for doctor shortages , such moves made sense because of the changing nature of care , with much more stress on looking after people with long-term conditions such as diabetes and heart disease rather than c@@ uring them . It said that as doctors only made up about one in 10 of the workforce much more was needed from other health staff , but the Nuffield Trust admitted money would need to be set aside to ensure it happened . Are nurses the new doctors ? NHS short of front-line staff , MPs say Report author Cand@@ ace I@@ mis@@ on said there were &quot; huge opportunities &quot; in reshap@@ ing the workforce , in both improving patient care and providing staff with more rewarding roles . And NHS Employers chief executive Danny Mortimer said : &quot; Our challenge now is to take forward the learning and recommendations in the report . &quot; But British Medical Association leader Dr Mark Porter said while he supported increasing the skills of the workforce , this should not be done &quot; at the expense of good quality training for doctors or indeed doctors themselves . &quot; &quot; It takes doctors many years to learn how to provide the best care for their patients , and there is no substitute for this kind of expertise and experience , &quot; he said . &quot; There should be more staff support for doctors to help them coordinate the best possible care for their patients . &quot; And Unison head of health Christina McA@@ ne@@ a said the squeeze on funding in the health service meant there was &quot; all too often &quot; no funding for training courses . &quot; Devel@@ oping the NHS support workforce must not be seen as a quick and cheap fix for the chronic shortages of nurses and other health workers across the country , &quot; she added .

S-120	The scheme , developed by the OU , has been designed to observe students &apos; paths through courses and engagement with online learning modules . The OU &apos;s Prof John Dom@@ ing@@ ue told the BBC : &quot; This has been developed as a tool for tutors to help students . &quot; We are planning to use this data for students studying in 2015-16 . &quot; The programme , called OU Analy@@ se , was developed at the university during the 2013-14 academic year . It uses a variety of data sets held by the OU and assesses the likelihood of a student submitting their next assignment by using information gathered from four different algorithms . The more algorithms that indicate the student will not send in their work - the higher the chance of that happening . Prof Dom@@ ing@@ ue added : &quot; We take advantage of the fact that modules are presented many times . One can use the experience of previous students to benefit future students . An interesting fact is that the data of the interactions before the course actually starts , like reading the material available and engaging with forums , is extremely valuable . &quot; Currently it is deployed on 13 modules , mostly level one modules in order to try to provide timely indicators that students may be struggling . &quot; The model is tailored to each of the modules and by using this and identifying students , more tailored support may be provided . &quot; The OU has taken steps to ensure that students &apos; privacy is not compromised by the scheme - putting in place an ethics policy , agreed in consultation with a student committee , to protect their data . Ruth Tudor , president of the Open University &apos;s Students &apos; Association , thinks the scheme is a positive one . &quot; It &apos;s a great idea and a great way of providing targeted support to students who may be struggling and need extra help , &quot; she told the BBC . &quot; I would like to think that this would improve the drop@@ -out rate from OU courses . You must remember they take students who have come from no academic background so it is always possible that those people take on more than they think they can manage . &quot; That &apos;s why data analytics will help provide extra support and can help them be successful . &quot; Reports suggest that some other British universities are thinking of using similar methods and Ms Tudor added : &quot; I don &apos;t see why this shouldn &apos;t happen in other universities . It has happened in the USA and I &apos;m surprised they &apos;re not using it here . &quot;

S-182	In the year to the end of March , 57 victims of homicide ( murders and culpable homicides ) were recorded - down five on the previous 12 months . This is the lowest number of recorded homicide cases for a single 12-month period since 1976 and half the figure of nine years ago . As of 31 March 2016 , only one case of homicide recorded in 2015-16 was unresolved . The report Hom@@ icide in Scotland showed that a sharp instrument remained the most common method of killing in Scotland and accounted for 51 % of homicides ( 29 cases ) in 2015-16 . Nearly all of these cases ( 26 out of 29 ) involved a knife . While the majority of the accused had an unknown status for alcohol and drugs , 31 % ( 20 people ) were identified by the police as being under the influence of alcohol or alcohol and drugs . Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said : &quot; While it is encouraging to see continued falls in homicide cases alongside the long-term decline in violent crime , the sustained efforts that have helped achieve this - through education and enforcement - must continue , because each of the lives lost is one life too many . &quot; There is a clear role across a range of public services , in addition to the critical work of our police , to continue to support communities that may remain at risk from violent crime and to challenge irresponsible attitudes both to alcohol misuse and to so-called &apos; casual &apos; violence . &quot; We will continue to work with partners and invest in a range of projects to help steer our young people away from the risks of a life of violence and crime , while also ensuring our law enforcement agencies and the courts have the powers and resources needed to deal with those who do harm to others . &quot; Scottish Labour &apos;s justice spokeswoman Claire Baker said : &quot; Whilst I welcome the overall downward trend in homicides in Scotland we have to take these statistics with a note of caution . &quot; Last year when the Scottish government were heral@@ ding &apos; record low &apos; homicide figures after a supposed similar drop , the actual figures were being revised upwards to show an increase . &quot; Meanwhile , sexual crime in Scotland sits at a 45-@@ year high and in the past year we have seen an increase in violent crime with attempted murder and serious assault rising by a staggering 27 % . &quot; The number of homicide victims for 2014-15 stood at 59 last year but later increased to 62 , after three cases were re@@ classified following deaths .

S-393	Older People &apos;s Commissioner for Wales Sarah Roch@@ ira will call on pensioners and their friends and families to hear their experiences of residential care . The evidence will be used to develop recommendations for care providers and public bodies . It is part of Ms Roch@@ ira &apos;s review into the quality of life and care of older people in residential care in Wales . She said she would highlight good care but also show the impact of poor care upon older people . &quot; The voices of older people , as well as those who care for and care about them , are at the heart of my work as commissioner , which is why I want to hear about their experiences of residential care , &quot; she said . &quot; I have travelled extensively across Wales , meeting with many older people living in residential care , and have seen for myself the positive impact that high quality care can have on people &apos;s lives . &quot; However , I have also received an increasing amount of correspondence in the past year about the quality of life and care of older people living in residential care and I have spoken publicly about what I consider to be unacceptable variations across Wales . &quot; The commissioner will be reviewing whether older people living in residential care have a good quality of life by looking at factors such as physical and psychological health , social relationships and the care home environment . Her team will also speak to care providers , social care staff and public bodies . &quot; By giving a voice to older people and their families , my review and recommendations will ensure that those who are accountable for and run our services understand the day-to-day realities of living in residential care in Wales and the action required to deliver the change needed to ensure that that older people living in residential care have the best quality of life , &quot; she said . The chair of Care Forum Wales , Mario Kre@@ ft , said his group was dedicated to developing and promoting best practice in social care and it supported the overall aims of the review . &quot; Our disappointment however - which will be shared by many providers - is that the commissioner has not included a provider expert on the main advisory panel , &quot; he said . &quot; As far as we can see no-one who has lived in , worked in , managed or owned a care home is represented on the panel . &quot; In our view , this misses the opportunity for partnership working and to engage the sector fully into the advisory panel . &quot;

S-483	The magnit@@ u@@ de-@@ 4.8 quake struck at a depth of 15.@@ 5km ( 9.@@ 6 miles ) 35@@ km north of the city of Luc@@ ca , officials said . The tremor was felt as far away as Milan and Florence , Italian media say . There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage . Italy is prone to earthquakes . In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L &apos;@@ Aqu@@ ila in the central Ab@@ ru@@ zzo region . Italy &apos;s National Institute of Ge@@ ophys@@ ics and Vol@@ can@@ ology ( IN@@ G@@ V ) said the quake struck at 15 : 48 ( 14 : 48 GMT ) , with its epicentre in Gar@@ f@@ agn@@ ana . Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area . Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Gar@@ f@@ agn@@ ana area , Italian news agency An@@ sa reports . As a precaution , schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage . In Milan , top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Mo@@ den@@ a . In Luc@@ ca , people poured out into the streets , An@@ sa said . Last May , two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead . The strongest tremor was magnit@@ u@@ de-@@ 6 and caused significant damage . Alessandro Ama@@ to of the IN@@ G@@ V said the latest tremor &quot; came out of nowhere , &quot; and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - &quot; medium-@@ strong &quot; and &quot; fairly shallow . &quot; Italy is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L &apos;@@ Aqu@@ ila . Six scientists and an ex-@@ official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement . The group , all members of the National Commission for the Forec@@ ast and Prevention of Serious Ris@@ ks , were accused of having provided &quot; inaccurate , incomplete and contradictory &quot; information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of the 6 April 2009 quake . At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake , they had told officials in L &apos;@@ Aqu@@ ila that , while a major earthquake was not impossible , it was not likely . On the night of the quake , many people are said to have remained in their homes and died because of the advice , while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived .

S-492	Mr Schmidt told the BBC that the company did what was &quot; legally required &quot; to pay the right amount of taxes . Google paid Â £ 10m in UK corporate taxes between 2006 and 2011 . Mr Schmidt said it was up to the government to change its tax system if it wanted companies to pay more taxes . Speaking on BBC Radio 4 &apos;s Start the Week , he said : &quot; What we are doing is legal . I &apos;m rather perplex@@ ed by this debate , which has been going in the UK for some time , because I view taxes as not optional . &quot; I view that you should pay the taxes that are legally required . It &apos;s not a debate . You pay the taxes . &quot; If the British system changes the tax laws , then we will comply . If the taxes go up , we will pay more , if they go down , we will pay less . That is a political decision for the democracy that is the United Kingdom . &quot; Meanwhile , the head of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee , Margaret Hodge , has suggested a new committee should be established to oversee the tax arrangements of major firms . She told the Independent newspaper that such a committee could hear evidence from companies in secret , meaning that companies would not be able to hide their tax affairs behind confidentiality rules . Google , most of whose UK sales are routed through Ireland , is one of the multinationals strongly criticised for organising their tax affairs in ways that minimise the amounts they pay in the UK . Last week , European Union leaders agreed to tackle tax avoidance through an &quot; automatic information exchange between tax authorities &quot; to monitor the situation . The Google chairman has previously argued that corporate taxes should be levied in the country where it conducts economic activity and takes risks , rather than where products are consumed . He has also called for a debate on international tax reform . &quot; Politicians - not companies - &#91; should &#93; set the rules ... When legislators are doing the lobbying and companies are artic@@ ulating the law as it stands , it &apos;s a confusing spectacle for everyone , &quot; he recently wrote in the Observer . &quot; Our hope is to move the debate forward , with everyone engaged constructively in developing a clearer , simpler system - one in which companies that abide by the law know that the politicians who devised the rules are willing to defend and commend them . &quot;

S-329	After being reduced to 8-@@ 2 , they posted a score of 25@@ 5-7 , with Davies and Ben Foakes ( 90 ) sharing a stand of 130 . Yorkshire &apos;s run-@@ chase was undermined by a three-@@ wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Mea@@ ker , whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance . Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236 . Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend , Yorkshire were hoping to at@@ one by reaching Lord &apos;s for the first time since 2002 . They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs , the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover . But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies , then on 43 , off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary . Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite , who took 3-@@ 48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes . After losing Adam Lyth early , Yorkshire were well-placed on 7@@ 5-2 , but fast bowler Mea@@ ker ( 3-@@ 61 ) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow ( 13 ) , who lobbed tam@@ ely to mid-wicket , Ballance ( 32 ) and Jack Le@@ aning . Bresnan and Waite ( 38 ) did their best to repair the damage , but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-@@ off with seven balls remaining . Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London : &quot; Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires , everybody &apos;s pulling together . &quot; Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent , that partnership blew the game wide open . &quot; The position we got ourselves to , I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270 . &quot; But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs . &quot; Yorkshire captain Alex Lees : &quot; We are all gutted . We have played some great white-ball cricket this season , but when it has mattered we haven &apos;t been good enough . &quot; The bowlers were exceptional and we thought it was a re@@ achable target . We needed someone in the top five to make a contribution and we would have reached the target comfortably . &quot;

S-397	The US military says a strike targeting Taliban in the northern city of Kunduz may have caused &quot; collateral damage . &quot; Off@@ ering his &quot; deepest condolences , &quot; Mr Obama said he expected a &quot; full accounting of the facts &quot; and would then make a definitive judgement . At least 12 MSF staff members and seven patients were killed in the incident . The UN called the strikes &quot; inexcusable and possibly even criminal , &quot; with Secretary General Ban Ki-moon calling for a thorough and impartial investigation . &quot; International and Afghan military planners have an obligation to respect and protect civilians at all times , and medical facilities and personnel are the object of a special protection , &quot; said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights R@@ a &apos;@@ ad Al Hussein Zeid . The hospital , run by the medical charity MSF , was severely damaged by a series of strikes lasting more than an hour from 02 : 00 local time on Saturday . Dozens were also injured in the attack . MSF president Me@@ in@@ ie Nicol@@ ai described the incident as &quot; abhorrent and a grave violation of international humanitarian law . &quot; &quot; All indications currently point to the bombing being carried out by international Coalition forces , &quot; MSF said . A spokesman for US forces in Afghanistan , Col Brian Tri@@ bus , said on Saturday that US forces had conducted an air strike in Kunduz &quot; against individuals threatening the force &quot; at the same time . He added : &quot; The strike may have resulted in collateral damage to a nearby medical facility . &quot; President Obama expressed his &quot; deepest condolences &quot; for the deaths in a White House statement . He added : &quot; The Department of Defense has launched a full investigation , and we will await the results of that inquiry before making a definitive judgment as to the circumstances of this tragedy . &quot; MSF nurse La@@ jo@@ s Zol@@ tan J@@ ec@@ s was sleeping at the facility when it was hit . &quot; It was absolutely terrifying , &quot; he said . He saw a fellow nurse &quot; covered in blood , with wounds all over his body , &quot; a statement issued by MSF said . Mr J@@ ec@@ s and other staff went outside when the bombing stopped . &quot; What we saw was the hospital destroyed . We tried to take a look into one of the burning buildings . There are no words for how terrible it was . In the intensive care unit six patients were burning in their beds . &quot; The Afghan interior ministry said a group of 10 to 15 militants had been hiding in the hospital . The Taliban denied that any of its fighters were there . A Taliban statement described the air strikes which hit the hospital as &quot; deliberate , &quot; and carried out by &quot; the barbaric American forces . &quot; There has been intense fighting in Kunduz since Taliban fighters swept into the northern city on Monday .

The Russian embassy said it was investigating , but called local press reports &quot; distorted . &quot; The rapper had taken to the stage in a red de@@ el - a Mongol@@ ian robe - embroid@@ ered with a swasti@@ ka . Though associated with the Nazis , the swasti@@ ka is a traditional symbol in Mongolia that pre-@@ dates Hitler . Mr Su@@ kh@@ ba@@ atar &apos;s father , Sev@@ ji@@ di@@ in Su@@ kh@@ ba@@ atar , told a news conference that his son spent about 10 days in a coma after the beating . &quot; My son was hit in the face several times with a metal object and was seriously injured . His brain was seriously hurt , &quot; he said . Mr Su@@ kh@@ ba@@ atar displayed a book of traditional swasti@@ ka patterns to emphasise that it is not a hate symbol in his country . The Russian official accused of attacking the rapper has not been identified . In a statement , the Russian embassy said it was investigating press and social media reports of the assault . &quot; According to our preliminary information , &quot; it said , the reports were &quot; distorted , particularly about the date , the number of participants and the circumstances of the accident . &quot; Tens of millions of Soviet citizens died fighting the forces of Nazi Germany during World War Two . The swasti@@ ka is believed to have originated in India thousands of years ago , and was used in Mongolia as a symbol of eter@@ nity centuries before the Third Reich . Amar@@ man@@ d@@ akh Su@@ kh@@ ba@@ atar - who is known as Am@@ ra@@ a and is the lead singer of the band K@@ har Sar@@ n@@ ai &#91; Black Rose &#93; - frequently wears the symbol on stage , and his songs often refer to his country &apos;s history , culture and identity .

S-109	Ofsted says it has found evidence of children being taught in squalid conditions in three places in Birmingham which have now closed . Anyone running illegal schools could face a jail term of up to 51 weeks . Ministers are also consulting on plans for more regulation of places teaching for more than 6 to 8 hours a week . Sir Michael Wilshaw , Chief Inspector of Schools in England , told the BBC this week that his inspectors were visibly shocked by the conditions they found . It is understood that a total of 18 unregulated schools , mainly in Muslim communities in the Midlands , have been visited as part of an investigation in recent months . Three places in Birmingham have been closed and the owners are being investigated under suspicion of running an illegal school . Sir Michael said the cases uncovered were likely to be the &quot; tip of the iceberg &quot; and he was seriously concerned that children were at risk of being abused or radicalised . Any place where children are taught for more than 20 hours a week has to register as a school . Some places describing themselves as part-time education centres or &quot; flex@@ i schools &quot; are operating within the law providing support for home-@@ educated children . But Ofsted and ministers are concerned that some are taking advantage of the legal right to home educate to operate what are in fact illegal schools . In a letter to the education secretary on Friday , Sir Michael suggested officials had been slow to take decisive action in the three places which Ofsted had closed with the help of the local council . &quot; This was achieved in spite of your officials providing , what I believe to be , confusing and unhelpful advice to the propri@@ et@@ ors that they could now apply to register their provision . &quot; The government has provided funding for a team of six inspectors whose job will be to investigate illegal schools . While most of the places visited by Ofsted so far have been in Muslim communities , inspectors may also turn their attention to similar unregistered tuition centres operated by other groups . &quot; It will apply across the board , to any religious group whether Muslim group , Jewish group , or Christian group who wants to operate this sort of provision in unsafe accommodation , in un@@ hy@@ gi@@ enic and filthy accommodation . &quot; It will apply to all religious groups , I want to make that absolutely clear , &quot; Sir Michael told the BBC . The education secretary has now said she intends to go further . &quot; I have now asked Ofsted to prepare cases for prosecution against unregistered schools it has identified . For a child to spend a single day in one of these schools is unacceptable . &quot; In order for a prosecution to be brought against an unregistered school the Education Secretary has to give consent . The government consultation on further regulation runs until mid-@@ January .

S-414	Naz@@ an@@ in Zag@@ har@@ i-@@ Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years for allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran . Her husband , Richard Ratcliffe , has criticised the UK government for a lack of action and said the appeal against the term was happening in &quot; secret . &quot; It is understood it is being held in Tehran on Wednesday . Mrs Zag@@ har@@ i-@@ Ratcliffe , 38 has spent time in solitary confinement since her arrest at Tehran Airport last April , with her two-year-old daughter Gabri@@ ella . The child has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport and is being looked after by her grandparents . Mrs Zag@@ har@@ i-@@ Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail in September on charges that have not been disclosed . Mr Ratcliffe said the family could not go to his wife &apos;s appeal hearing and did not know when to expect a result as it was &quot; another of these secret trials . &quot; He said : &quot; Obviously her father is terrified , as am I. We are increasingly on ten@@ ter@@ hooks as to what could happen . &quot; Mr Ratcliffe , 41 , believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK . He said he will know when the appeal has happened and what was said in the courtroom but the final outcome &quot; might come today , it might come next week . &quot; There was a gap of about four weeks between his wife &apos;s trial and the verdict , he added . Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail but there was &quot; more fight in her &quot; since being moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas . He told BBC Breakfast the outcome of the appeal was &quot; unpredictable &quot; as it could see her sentence quashed , reduced or increased . Speaking about his daughter , Mr Ratcliffe said : &quot; I have watched her grow up on Skype . &quot; She has lost her English , and she is now pretty much fluent in Far@@ si - with only a few words in English . &quot; Conver@@ sations now either have to be translated through one of her aun@@ ts and uncles or they are very physical - so playing pe@@ ek@@ ab@@ oo and watching her dancing . &quot; Mr Ratcliffe said he was trying to get a visa so he could visit his wife and daughter . Amnesty International UK said Mrs Zag@@ har@@ i-@@ Ratcliffe was a &quot; prisoner of conscience &quot; who was being held for &quot; peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression and association . &quot; Risk campaign manager Kathy V@@ oss added : &quot; Though she shouldn &apos;t even find herself in this awful position , we very much hope the appeal will rule in Naz@@ an@@ in &apos;s favour and order her immediate release . &quot;

S-143	Washington blamed Russia and the Syrian government for intensifying their attacks against civilians . Last week , the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo . Russia said it regretted the US move , accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month &apos;s truce . Aleppo , Syria &apos;s largest city in the north , has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago . The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week , activists said on Monday . Hundreds of people , including children , have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed . Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo . In a statement , state department spokesman jo@@ hn Kirby said : &quot; The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities . &quot; Unfortunately , Russia failed to live up to its own commitments ... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adher@@ ence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed . &quot; Rather , Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course , &quot; Mr Kirby said , admitting that &quot; this is not a decision that was taken lightly . &quot; He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s troops had been &quot; targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals , and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need , including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy . &quot; Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike , and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike . In response to the US suspension of the talks , Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakhar@@ ova said : &quot; We regret this decision by Washington . &quot; &quot; Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo . &quot; After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out , they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else , &quot; Ms Zakhar@@ ova said . She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition . Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups , but American officials were told to return home . The US also said that it would withdraw personnel &quot; that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint ( US-@@ Russian ) Im@@ pl@@ em@@ entation Centre . &quot; However , the two sides would keep talking about counter-terrorism operations in Syria to avoid unnecessary clashes .

S-73	Cuadrilla , the firm behind the tests , said drilling had been suspended as a precaution after the 1.5 magnitude tremor - the second in two months . It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey ( B@@ GS ) before deciding whether to resume . A tremor centred on Poul@@ ton-@@ le-@@ Fylde on 1 April shared a &quot; similar location and mechanism , &quot; the BS@@ G said . Sha@@ le gas drilling , known as &quot; fracking , &quot; involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions . Mark Miller , chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources , said : &quot; We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts . &quot; We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that . &quot; The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite . But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice . The B@@ GS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution . There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March , including the latest on Friday . In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the B@@ GS said : &quot; Any process that in@@ jects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes . &quot; It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and ge@@ other@@ mal engineering , such as Sha@@ le gas , processes can result in earthquake activity . &quot; The B@@ GS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles ( 2km ) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles ( 80km ) away . Speaking about the latest quake , Dr Brian Bap@@ tie , head of seism@@ ology at the B@@ GS , said : &quot; The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poul@@ ton-@@ L@@ e-@@ Fylde . &quot; Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Pre@@ ese Hall site . &quot; Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site , installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April , indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km ( 1.2 miles ) . &quot; The recorded wav@@ e@@ forms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month , which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism . &quot;

S-205	Owens , Rhys Hanbury and Paddy Flynn all crossed before half-time as the hosts opened up a 16-@@ point lead . Cameron Phelps looked to have made the game safe , but quick tries from Ryan Atkins and Chris Bridge made it 24-@@ 10 . Owens grabbed his second of the game before Stefan Ratchford went over for Wolves , but Widnes held for the bragging rights in the local derby . Warrington remain fifth in the Super League table , while eigh@@ th-placed Widnes are three points clear of Hull KR , in ninth , who have a game in hand . Danny Tick@@ le converted the first try of the night from Owens , who latched onto a cut@@ -out pass on the left flank . Hanbury exploited a massive gap in the Warrington defence to go over and Flynn scored the home side &apos;s third try , after St@@ ef Marsh &apos;s flick pass out of the back door created the opportunity . The Vikings &apos; 16-@@ 0 half-time lead was extended when Phelps finished off Flynn &apos;s weaving run . Atkins &apos; special solo try was followed by Bridge going over to give Warrington a glimmer of hope , but Owens collected Kevin Brown &apos;s kick for his second try . Ratchford grabbed the visitors &apos; third try but it was too little too late . Widnes coach Denis Betts : &quot; It &apos;s been coming the last couple of weeks . We &apos;ve had a few solid performances but not getting the result . &quot; To hold a nil lead for Warrington , such a fantastic attacking team , was a great plus in the first half . And then to withstand it and score more points was a great performance for a lot of our players . &quot; Everyone did their job . Our pack was massive and there &apos;s not a player who didn &apos;t give us something . &quot; Warrington coach Tony Smith : &quot; Widnes took their chances well . We didn &apos;t take our opportunities , we didn &apos;t create enough . &quot; We were boring and didn &apos;t ask enough questions . Our opponents were good and took their chances . &quot; I thought Widnes out-@@ enthused us at crucial times and I think our team will respond and fix things up . &quot; We accept defeat and will work harder , improve and be stronger next week . &quot; Widnes : Hanbury , Owens , Phelps , Marsh , Flynn , Brown , Mellor , Cahill , Clarke , Gerrard , Gal@@ ea , Tick@@ le , Leuluai .

S-210	A team from Glasgow University studied recorded speech of Glaswegi@@ ans from the early 20th Century to the present . They found evidence of common UK accent changes , such as the use of &quot; f &quot; for &quot; th &quot; in words like think , and a dropped letter &apos; l &apos; , as in people to pe@@ op@@ o . Overall though , the researchers said the Scots accent remained distinctive . The three-year Sounds of the City study , was led by Professor Jane Stu@@ ar@@ t-@@ Smith , director of the university &apos;s laboratory of ph@@ one@@ tics . &quot; We were quite surprised by what we found , &quot; she said . &quot; The assumption is that traditional dial@@ ects generally across the UK are being eroded and some are dying out altogether , but what we have learned , particularly with the Glasgow accent , is that Scots accents are actually flourishing . &quot; Interestingly , what is not happening in Scotland is the dil@@ ution of accents to a more hom@@ ogen@@ ised ang@@ lic@@ ised accent on the scale that we are seeing in England , and in fact the Scots accent remains very distinctive . &quot; As part of its study , the Glasgow team built up a digiti@@ sed body of recorded speech sounds . The team said its work suggested the distinctive Scots accent had undergone two kinds of changes . One set are common accent changes , which have spread right across the UK , such as the &quot; f &quot; and &quot; l &quot; examples . The team said this change was being spread partly by dial@@ ect contact and partly by the popularity of TV shows set in London . The project also uncovered a second set of fin@@ er changes local to Scotland . These included how v@@ ow@@ els were pronounced in words such as boat , goat and coat , or stop sounds that are pronounced in words like pin , top and cat . The researchers anticipated these sounds either to be stable over time , or perhaps to be changing in the same way as in Anglo-@@ English accents . Their evidence suggested , however , that these features and others were all changing , the changes were local to Scotland and not affected by Anglo-@@ English changes , and that they had been happening for 100 years or more . The Glasgow team said the trigger for some of these changes appeared to be the period around the First World War . The study focused on six audio recordings , made in 1916 and held by the British Library , of Scots soldiers from German Pris@@ oner of War camps . From those recordings researchers found evidence to show that even a century ago , and perhaps even earlier , Scottish accents were already changing . The research and findings of the project will be made available to students and other researchers via an online resource .

S-249	Glamorgan &apos;s total was dominated by Nick Sel@@ man &apos;s mature 101 off 144 balls , his second first-class century . But seamers Matt Taylor and Craig Miles made sure wickets fell at regular intervals in cloudy conditions in the Welsh capital . Gloucestershire struggled in turn as the bowlers remained on top all day . Sel@@ man &apos;s century , after being dropped on eight in the first over , was a welcome return to form for the Bris@@ ban@@ e-@@ born opener after a string of low scores following his hundred against Northants at Swansea . Aneurin Donald &apos;s quick-@@ fire 36 off 30 balls was the next best contribution as Taylor and Miles prosper@@ ed in the afternoon . Graham Wagg and Timm van der Gugten scrambled Glamorgan to a consolation bonus point . Gloucestershire &apos;s innings was a question of survival in the evening gloom , with the day ending evenly balanced . Glamorgan are being led by Michael Hogan for the first time in the absence of Jacques Rudolph , who has a neck problem . Glamorgan batsman Nick Sel@@ man told BBC Wales Sport : &quot; It was good to get some runs for a change , the wicket was a bit slow and they bowled a bit short early on so I got through the first 25 overs and it got easier to bat from there , but it was a bit disappointing to get out just after I got a hundred . &quot; ( My season ) was going well up until after ( a century in ) Swansea , after Swansea four ducks in a row , but it was good to spend some time in the middle at Northants . &quot; Opening the batting in county cricket over here ( in the UK ) , it &apos;s definitely hard , you get some good balls , you play on some green wickets and I was struggling a bit . &quot; I was happy to get a few today and hopefully I can continue that for the rest of the season . &quot; Gloucestershire seamer Matt Taylor told BBC Radio Bristol : &quot; There &apos;s definitely a bit on offer out there ( for the bowlers ) , we didn &apos;t start exactly how we &apos;d like but we got there in the end and we &apos;d take bowling them out for 220 . &quot; I was pretty happy with that ( hitting the stumps three times ) , the same plan as always is to hit the top of off-@@ stump and luckily they missed them today . &quot; I was pleased to get an opportunity in T20 and the white-ball stuff this year , now I &apos;m getting an opportunity with the red ball it &apos;s great . &quot; It &apos;s definitely going to be tough ( for the Gloucestershire batsmen ) , they &apos;re a good bowling attack but hopefully we can dig in and get to a reasonable score . &quot;

S-164	Cher@@ nova , now 27 , beat Briton Ennis-Hill to gold at the 2011 World Championships in Korea . This week she was given a ban and had earlier results annulled after a sample from 2009 was re-@@ tested - but kept her world title . &quot; She set a personal best with the benefit of drug use , &quot; Minichiello said . Russian anti-doping agency punished Cher@@ nova with a two-year ban , backdated to 22 June 2013 . It also annulled her results from 15 August 2009 to 14 August 2011 - a period that ended just 16 days before she won world gold in Da@@ egu with a personal best of 6,@@ 8@@ 80 points , beating defending champion Ennis-Hill &apos;s 6,7@@ 51 . Research carried out by the University of Oslo in October 2013 established that muscles can retain the advantages given by an@@ abolic steroids decades after the point at which they were taken . Minichiello wants athletics &apos; world governing body the IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency ( Wada ) to have a &quot; long , hard look &quot; at the Russian anti-doping agency &apos;s punishment . The IAAF told BBC Sport it is awaiting a full explanation from the Russian authorities before deciding whether it needs to take any action . &quot; Maybe it highlights that there is a gap within the anti-doping code which allows only a two-year ban from the initial test and then another ban from the date of the re-@@ test , &quot; added Minichiello . &quot; I think it should probably all run seamlessly and athletes should be banned for the whole time . Otherwise you have a ban for Cher@@ nova that really looks quite ineffective . &quot; Cher@@ nova &apos;s backdated ban is due to expire on 21 June , and with the qualification period for the 2015 World Championships in Beijing running until 10 August , she could compete both there and at the 2016 Rio Olympics . &quot; It would be frustrating if she lines up on the starting line but those are the rules out there and we need to abide by them , &quot; said Minichiello . &quot; That is why we think Wada needs to look at its code and penalties to show there is potentially a loophole that needs to be looked . I &apos;m sure the Russian anti-doping agency have administered suspensions according to the rules , so therefore it needs to be looked at . &quot; Last week , Russia &apos;s athletics head coach Valentin Mas@@ l@@ akov resigned after a number of athletes from the country were found guilty of committing doping offences . Wada is investigating allegations of widespread doping and corruption in Russian athletics after claims were aired in a recent German television documentary , with a report due to be published by the end of the year . The IAAF said last week it was concerned about the number of Russian doping cases in the sport .

S-131	Pro-@@ Kremlin party A Just Russia put forward both bills , and linked them directly to the situation in Ukraine . Separ@@ ati@@ st and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine &apos;s Crimea region , which is now the focus of the crisis . Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory &apos;s leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions . There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea . In Sevast@@ opol , base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet , a majority hold Russian passports . Under Russia &apos;s existing law , a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new &quot; subject &quot; of the Russian Federation . But Mikhail Yem@@ el@@ yan@@ ov , deputy leader of A Just Russia , said the law had been drafted for peaceful times , and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart . &quot; In conditions where a neighbouring state is dis@@ integrating I don &apos;t think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia , &quot; he said . Since Russia &apos;s war with Georgia in 2008 , the breakaway Georgian territories of Ab@@ k@@ haz@@ ia and South Osse@@ tia have come under Moscow &apos;s control . Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia &apos;s authority . The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia &apos;s lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports . Pas@@ sport applicants would not have to pay a state tax , and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required . In addition , they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship . The bill &apos;s pre@@ am@@ ble says it is aimed &quot; at supporting the frater@@ nal people of Ukraine , especially the Russian-@@ speaking ones , who are defenceless in the face of the &apos; brown threat &apos; , &quot; a reference to World War Two fas@@ cists who wore brown uniforms . The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August , and they could become citizens after two months , instead of waiting a year , as is currently the norm . The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevast@@ opol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mir@@ on@@ ov . Several Russian MPs have also gone to Crimea , including Russian celebrities - former Olympic ice skating champion Irina Rod@@ n@@ ina , former cos@@ mon@@ a@@ ut Valent@@ ina Ter@@ esh@@ kova and heavyweight boxer Nikol@@ ai Valu@@ ev .

S-428	Swansea University &apos;s Dr Neil Lo@@ ader and Emer@@ itus Prof Al@@ ayne Stre@@ et-@@ Per@@ r@@ ott , are among a team who have found ancient earth@@ works , possibly 2,000 years old . The discoveries were made in A@@ cr@@ e state in the western Brazilian Amazon . Researchers from the universities of Exeter and Reading , and Brazil &apos;s S@@ Ã £ o Paulo , Bel@@ Ã © m are also part of the team . Their research investigated ditched en@@ closures which were concealed for centuries by bam@@ boo@@ -@@ dominated rainforest until modern deforestation allowed the discovery of more than 450 large ge@@ ome@@ tr@@ ical &quot; ge@@ og@@ ly@@ ph@@ s . &quot; The team said the function of these mysterious sites is still little understood . They are unlikely to be villages , since archaeologists have recovered very few artefacts during excavation , and their layout does not suggest they were built for defensive reasons . Instead it is thought they were used only spor@@ ad@@ ically , perhaps as ritual gathering places , similar to the Maya pyr@@ am@@ ids of Central America , or Britain &apos;s own Stonehenge . Although Dr Lo@@ ader - who has analysed soil samples from the ge@@ og@@ ly@@ ph@@ s - said the surroundings in which they were built were very different to other ritual sites around the world . He looked at phy@@ tol@@ iths - a type of microscopic plant fossil made of sil@@ ica - to reconstruct ancient vegetation ; char@@ coal quantities , to assess the amount of ancient forest burning ; and carbon stable isot@@ opes , to indicate the type of vegetation growing there in the past . &quot; The indications are that the ge@@ og@@ ly@@ ph@@ s were constructed amongst taller vegetation . So , unlike the towering Maya pyr@@ am@@ ids of Central America , they were likely not visible above the forest canopy , and this raises questions about their purpose , &quot; he explained . It had been assumed prior to the arrival of Europeans in the early 16th Century , the Amaz@@ onian forests had been pristine ecosystems , free from human influence . But the new research indicates a wide variety of plant species spread over 6,000 years , which could only have been artificially brought together by humans . It suggested instead of burning large tracts of forest - either for ge@@ og@@ ly@@ ph construction or agricultural practices - people transformed their environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees such as pal@@ ms . The team have likened it to a form of &quot; prehistoric supermarket &quot; of useful forest products . They said there is &quot; tant@@ ali@@ zing evidence &quot; to suggest the biodiversity of some of A@@ cr@@ e &apos;s remaining forests may retain a strong legacy of these ancient &quot; ag@@ ro@@ forestry &quot; practices to this day .

S-110	Pte Matthew Boyd , 20 , was off-duty on a night out in Brecon when he was punched and beaten by Jake Vall@@ ely . But the jury cleared Vall@@ ely &apos;s friend A@@ aer@@ on Evans of manslaughter after Cardiff Crown Court was told he was not present during the attack . Vall@@ ely , 24 , will be sentenced on 8 December . The unconscious body of Pte Boyd , who served with the Royal Gibraltar Regiment , was found by police in the town in the early hours of 8 May . Pte Boyd , who is originally from Carrickfergus , County Antrim , had been in the town for training exercises at the infantry battle school . During the trial , the court heard Pte Boyd was making his way back to the barracks when he was attacked outside a bar called The C@@ ellar . CCTV footage showed the soldier being punched , going to the ground and being beaten until he no longer moved . Vall@@ ely then dragged his body from the scene before fleeing . The trial was told the killer had been on a seven hour drinking binge and in the hour before the attack was boasting he was the &quot; hardest man in Brecon . &quot; His friend Mr Evans was cleared of any involvement in the attack , after the jury was told he had left the scene before the start of any violence . Senior investigating officer Det Supt David Guin@@ ey , from Dyfed-Powys Police , called the attack &quot; a despicable act &quot; that &quot; shocked &quot; the community of Brecon . &quot; I plead with anyone who plans a night out drinking with their friends to please , walk away from any conflict , do not resort to violence , &quot; he said . A family tribute described Pte Boyd as an &quot; all-rounder &quot; who had &quot; a promising career ahead of him which has been cut short . &quot; The tribute read : &quot; Matthew was full of life . He was loving , caring and loyal . He was always playing jokes on his peers and family , and always brought smiles to our faces . &quot; It said Vall@@ ely had created &quot; a void in our family that will never be filled , &quot; adding the &quot; unbearable pain &quot; was something they will have to live with for the rest of their lives . &quot; During this trial , it has been mentioned that Jake Vall@@ ely called himself the &apos; hardest man in Brecon &apos; on the night that he murdered Matthew , &quot; the tribute said . &quot; He couldn &apos;t have been more wrong . There has been such a massive outpouring of love from the community in Brecon towards our family ; in our mind , those are the strongest people in Brecon . &quot;

S-13	Muir , 23 , broke McColgan &apos;s 25-year-old record by 14 seconds at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow on Wednesday , with a time of 14 minutes , 49.@@ 12 seconds . McColgan said she felt excited to see her last record broken by Muir . She had earlier raised concerns about whether Muir &apos;s race had met all the criteria set by UK Athletics for record-breaking attempts . She had told BBC radio &apos;s John Beattie programme it needed to be a &quot; genuine race &quot; and may not have been as &quot; Muir had been the only competitor . &quot; &quot; It was a mixed 3@@ K race where all the other girls ran 3@@ K and it was only Laura who finished the 5@@ K , &quot; she said . &quot; We were wondering if to get a record ratified you have to have drug testing as well . &quot; So we were just wondering if they had everything in place to actually have it ratified as a record . &quot; However , British Athletics confirmed Muir &apos;s time was expected to be classified as official . A spokesman said : &quot; The time will undergo ratification but is expected to be confirmed . &quot; Rules stipul@@ ate that if there is no doping control at an event where a British record is set , there is no requirement for the athlete to submit drug tests . McColgan said Muir had what it took to win world medals . &quot; To run 14.@@ 49 indoors is pretty good , &quot; she said . &quot; But she is a 3.@@ 55 minute 1,@@ 500m runner , so you would expect someone like Laura to run ( 5@@ K ) in something like 14.@@ 30 . &quot; So there &apos;s still a lot more in the tank and I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the fastest 5@@ K she &apos;s ever going to run . &quot; She &apos;s got the ability to get down to 14.@@ 30 , which is really mixing it with the top in the world . &quot; McColgan said Muir &apos;s race , which saw her lap other runners , had been similar to her own record-breaking race 25 years ago . &quot; I ran on my own right from the start with nobody really pushing me at all , &quot; she said . &quot; I actually l@@ apped a young Paula Radcliffe about two or three times . &quot; McColgan said it was a bonus that her record was beaten by a fellow Scot . &quot; She is world class , &quot; she said . &quot; She just needs to get her race tactics right so that she can start winning some medals . &quot; Muir broke her own British 1500m record at the Diamond League meeting in Paris in August and reached the 1,@@ 500m Olympic final at Rio 2016 .

S-325	A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-@@ 20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Ho@@ h@@ neck was yellow carded . Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-@@ b@@ inning , scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up . But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May , Marshall , Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester &apos;s win . The Cherry and Whites , who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year , won the competition in 2015 . Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent &apos;s second-tier title in 2010 . In a se@@ es@@ aw@@ ing opening 40 minutes , scores were locked on four separate occasions , with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues &apos; Steven Shingler and Gloucester &apos;s Billy Burns swapped penalties . More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns , following a head injury , as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall &apos;s first try put Gloucester 20-@@ 13 up . However , Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break . Shingler extended that lead to six , but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side , who had Wales &apos; Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship . England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kin@@ gh@@ olm to see May , the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign , cross for the first of the hosts &apos; four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term .

S-484	The poster with the phrase # pray@@ for@@ j@@ osh appeared in Holywood by the A@@ 2 within the last week . It is part of a social media campaign supporting 13-year-old Joshua Martin , from Don@@ ag@@ ha@@ dee , County Down . Life took a dramatic turn for the teenager when he was diagnosed with cancer on Christmas Eve . He was due to have an operation on his ap@@ pendix at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast . However , doctors instead discovered and removed a large primary cancer and five smaller grow@@ ths . The news shocked Josh &apos;s family , but since his diagnosis they have received lots of support from people all over the world . It began as a hashtag on Facebook and Instagram by Bangor Eli@@ m Church , where Josh &apos;s father is on the pastoral staff , and has since gone viral . The church &apos;s senior pastor , Gary Beattie , said he was amazed by how many people have supported Josh and his family so far . &quot; We were in total shock when he was diagnosed , and really the family just wanted support from people and to ask people to pray for Josh , &quot; Gary said . &quot; It certainly isn &apos;t a campaign as such , we just put the hashtag on our Facebook posts to get some of our congregation thinking about him . We had no idea that it would take off . &quot; We would use social media quite a lot because we have quite a young congregation , and we &apos;ve been posting updates about Josh from his family . &quot; The update was shared 9@@ 48 times and it &apos;s been seen by over 7@@ 9,000 people . It &apos;s absolutely phenomenal . &quot; We thought there had been a mistake , but you can look at the views and where they &apos;ve come from , and there are people all over the world supporting him , which is great . &quot; But how did a social media hashtag lead to the appearance of the massive billboard ? Gary said that last week a mystery donor paid for the sign and it was erected at Holywood playing fields . &quot; We do not know where it came from , we didn &apos;t put it there , but it means a lot to have such support , &quot; Gary said . There has also been a huge outpouring of support on Twitter for the Bangor Grammar pupil , with his classmates using the now-@@ global hashtag for their friend . As Josh &apos;s family and friends continue to support him in his recovery , it now seems there will be people all over the world will be following suit , thanks to the kindness of County Down strangers .

S-421	Hanson Academy strictly enforced its school uniform policy on Tuesday , with almost 10 % of pupils failing to reach the academy &apos;s standards . Angry parents took to the school &apos;s Facebook page to complain about the new measures . But Hanson Academy claims it &quot; communicated clearly &quot; its expectations for this school year . Pupils face being sent home for a variety of reasons , including if they wear hoo@@ p ear@@ rings , two ear@@ rings or more per ear or patter@@ ned trousers . Students are also not allowed to have an un@@ natural hair colour or wear jumpers , jackets or coats indoors , and there are strict rules about the type of footwear allowed . Principal Elizabeth Chur@@ ton told the BBC that a further 63 pupils were sent home on Wednesday . She said in an earlier statement : &quot; We explained that students who arrived to school with a uniform issue that could be resolved would be sent home to rectify and parents would be contacted . &quot; As fore@@ warned , some students were sent home for this reason . &quot; They were sent home to change and the majority rectified this immediately and returned to school ready to learn . &quot; The principal said rules were an important part of growing up to get students ready for &quot; adult life . &quot; She said : &quot; This is part and parcel of a much wider push on conduct , on behaviour , on attitudes and respect . &quot; Uni@@ form and the way in which we wear our clothes is all part and parcel of the way in which we communicate with each other . &quot; It is all part of the educational experience which you would find in any good to outstanding school . &quot; C@@ aren Ox@@ la@@ ide &apos;s son was one of those sent home for not wearing the regulation black leather shoes . She said : &quot; It states black shoes , lac@@ e-up , no trainers and flat-@@ sol@@ ed . That &apos;s exactly what his are , pure leather . &quot; She said buying new shoes was not an easy option . &quot; I can &apos;t really afford them , not on income support . But I &apos;ve got to somehow do it because my son &apos;s education is important . &quot; Diane Hickey &apos;s daughter Cassidy , 13 , was sent home on Wednesday because she was wearing black pumps . &quot; I &apos;m not buying her a new pair of shoes . I &apos;m a single parent . I can &apos;t afford a new pair of shoes , &quot; she said . Another parent expressed concerns about how they were being informed their children had been sent home . Fiona Taylor , who has two children aged 13 and 11 at the school , said : &quot; Parents yesterday didn &apos;t receive text messages until after 14 : 00 . &quot; So all day their children have been sent away and these parents who were out at work did not get informed until late in the afternoon . &quot; The school insists it will persist with the policy , but Mrs Chur@@ ton admitted there had been mixed feedback from parents . She said the school would work with parents who were struggling to dress their children appropriately .

S-48	Mr Swinney said the UK government &apos;s recent spending review placed &quot; unprecedented pressure &quot; on public expenditure north of the border . The UK government said Scottish ministers would have £ 39@@ 0m more in spending available to them next year . Mr Swinney is due to present his 2016-17 spending plans on Wednesday . The Scottish government argues that cuts imposed by the UK government since 2010 - along with last month &apos;s spending review - mean that its discretionary budget will be 12.5 % lower in real terms by 2019-20 than it was in 2010-11 . Mr Swinney said 4.2 % of that reduction would come between now and 2019-20 . He said : &quot; The chancellor ( George Osborne ) has imposed real terms cuts on Scotland every year from now until 2020 , and more than £ 1bn of those cuts are still to come between now and the end of the decade . &quot; We have demonstrated that the UK government didn &apos;t have to take this approach . Debt and the deficit could have been reduced without this scale of cuts that has been chosen by the chancellor . &quot; Now Scotland has to deal with the reality of the chancellor &apos;s decision . We face tough choices in the coming days . &quot; Against this backdrop , the Scottish government is determined that we will defend and protect the key priorities that the people of Scotland expect us to deliver on . &quot; Mr Swinney said schools , hospitals and the police service in Scotland would &quot; not be sacrificed to the chancellor &apos;s austerity obsession . &quot; He added : &quot; In recent years we have been able to deliver better outcomes for the people of Scotland . More police , lower crime , better schools , tu@@ iti@@ on-@@ free university education and a health budget that is at a record level . &quot; These commitments demonstrate the prioriti@@ sation of the Scottish government . &quot; Responding to Mr Swinney comments , a spokesman for the UK government &apos;s Scotland Office said : &quot; The Scottish government will have £ 39@@ 0m more spending available to it next year , which rises to £ 750m if you include its own under@@ spend . &quot; The stability of the UK economy means the block grant will be almost £ 30bn . &quot; One look at the current oil price tells you this is a much better deal for people in Scotland than the constitutional alternative favoured by the Scottish government . &quot; The Scottish government should perhaps focus more on gearing up for its new powers and getting the best for Scotland , rather than grievance . &quot; Labour &apos;s public services spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said : &quot; Ahead of the most important budget since devolution , it &apos;s time John Swinney backed up his anti-austerity pos@@ turing with something real . &quot; T@@ elling us about pre-election giv@@ eaways now and cuts later isn &apos;t good enough . This needs to be a long-term budget . &quot; Scotland needs a government that spends less time congrat@@ ulating itself on its spin and more time explaining its record . &quot; Scottish Labour will offer a real alternative to austerity , with different decisions on tax to the Tories , and different decisions on tax to the SNP . &quot;

S-220	The move apparently follows a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &apos;s office . It also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli-@@ Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry . On Friday , the US chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction . The decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu , whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had &quot; ir@@ on@@ clad information &quot; from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and &quot; pushed hard &quot; for its passage . A US state department spokesman said the accusation was &quot; just not true , &quot; but he hoped the resolution would &quot; serve as a wake-up call &quot; for Israel . More than 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel &apos;s 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem . The settlements are considered illegal under international law , though Israel disputes this . The Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements &quot; has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just , lasting and comprehensive peace . &quot; Israel rejected the resolution , and the BBC &apos;s Yol@@ ande K@@ nell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital , but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state . Mr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summon@@ ing the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution , recalling Israel &apos;s ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal , cutting aid to Senegal , and cancelling a visit by Ukraine &apos;s prime minister . The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 4@@ 92 new homes in the settlements of Ram@@ at Sh@@ l@@ omo and Ram@@ ot . But on Wednesday , planning committee member Han@@ an Rubin said the vote had been postponed . Mr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister &apos;s office , to avoid further str@@ aining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry &apos;s speech . &quot; It &apos;s in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel , &quot; he said . &quot; We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families ... and if there is a big storm and Kerry &apos;s speech today , we are looking to avoid this conflict . &quot; Mr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel@@ -@@ Palestinian conflict , and address what a senior state department official described as &quot; misleading cri@@ ti@@ ques &quot; of the Obama administration by the Israeli government . Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said the resolution &quot; paves the way &quot; for the upcoming conference on Middle East peace in France on 15 January . &quot; We hope this conference comes up with a mechanism and timetable to end the occupation , &quot; he told a meeting of his Fatah party on Monday .

S-497	Barry Pr@@ ing , 47 , was killed by a speeding car as he tried to hail a taxi on the hard shoulder of a dual carriageway in Kiev in 2008 . His wife , G@@ anna Zi@@ uz@@ ina , had returned to a restaurant for a missing glove . The coroner at Exeter County Hall , Dr Elizabeth Ear@@ land , recorded a verdict of unlawful killing . More on the millionaire &apos; murdered &apos; by his wife , and other news She said : &quot; His guard was lowered by in@@ ebri@@ ation . The car had stolen licence plates and did not brake or stop . &quot; I am satisfied that having heard all the evidence ... much of it circum@@ stantial , nevertheless , in my view it is overwhelming . &quot; I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Barry John Pr@@ ing has been unlawfully killed . &quot; She said the case demonstrated the difficulty in investigating a case of a death abroad , adding : &quot; Our thoughts and condolences must go to the family who have endured years and years of distress and unhappiness . &quot; Close friend Peter Clifford , a lawyer , told the inquest he had &quot; no reasonable doubt &quot; that Barry was murdered . Ms Zi@@ uz@@ ina , known as Anna , was 19 years younger than her husband . She tried to claim his assets within days of his death . His family believe he was killed in a staged hit and run accident . The couple met online in 2006 and were married in 2007 following a four-day engagement . Mr Pr@@ ing &apos;s mother , Irene Pr@@ ing , said Ms Zi@@ uz@@ ina claimed to be a teacher when the pair first met , but she was in fact a lap dancer and stri@@ pper . She said : &quot; We are sure Anna had some involvement in his death to inherit his money and property . &quot; I was quite surprised how cold she was with Barry . She did not lift a finger , she was a lazy thing . &quot; The inquest heard Ms Zi@@ uz@@ ina sold her husband &apos;s Range Rover , contents from his flat and moved funds from his bank account . The hearing was also told she was &quot; entitled to the first Â £ 200,000 of his estate &quot; and that computer records revealed &quot; she was having an affair with a Ukrainian man . &quot; Greater Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Ear@@ land said &quot; strenuous attempts &quot; had been made to get her to attend the inquest , but without success . In a statement , Ms Zi@@ uz@@ ina said she had made &quot; three separate statements to Ukrainian police &quot; and did not believe she could &quot; add anything further . &quot; Det Con Jonathan Watts , from Devon and Cornwall Police , said Mr Pr@@ ing was hit by a car with no lights , speeding at 75@@ mph . He also said witnesses at the scene in Kiev described the killing &quot; as a deliberate act . &quot; The Ukrainian police closed an inquiry into his death , but re@@ launched it in 2011 as a murder inquiry . The case is still active &quot; but not actively pursued . &quot;

There &apos;s an entire room dedicated to arcade games and even a pod@@ -@@ racer in the backyard . Only one room does not have Star Wars memorabilia in it - the main bathroom .

Rogue One has a lot of those elements too . &quot; Reporting by the BBC &apos;s Greg Dunlop

S-410	My@@ ra Forde &apos;s ex-@@ lawyer says she did not state that the late PM was a client , nor did she threaten to expose him if a prosecution against her was continued . Forde says she has &quot; no knowledge of any misconduct on his part &quot; and recent media coverage had caused her distress . The UK &apos;s historical child sex abuse inquiry is to examine claims about Sir Edward if &quot; the facts justify it . &quot; The Metropolitan , Wiltshire , Hampshire , Jersey and Kent forces are conducting separate inquiries into the late MP . The BBC understands Wiltshire Police halted an inquiry into Forde in the 1990s . On Monday , the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it would look at whether a case was dropped by Wiltshire Police when a person involved made claims against Sir Edward . Forde was later convicted of controlling prostitutes after a successful prosecution by the same force . She was jailed for six years after a trial that included allegations that she had supplied children as young as 13 to her clients . Fourteen years later Forde was prosecuted and jailed again for inciting prostitution . Richard Griffiths , Forde &apos;s solicitor in 1992 , has now spoken on her behalf to the Salisbury Journal . He told the newspaper : &quot; My former client wishes me to make it very clear that at no stage did she state that Ted Heath was a client and at no stage did she threaten to expose him as a client of hers if the prosecution was continued . &quot; For the avoidance of any doubt , My@@ ra Forde wishes me to make it clear that she had no involvement with Ted Heath of any kind and has no knowledge of any misconduct on his part . &quot; He also said that , at the time of that case , the prosecution &quot; took what , at the time , seemed a sensible decision that they could not prove their case and offered no evidence . &quot; Historical child abuse : Key investigations A spokesman for the UK &apos;s ongoing independent inquiry into child sexual abuse , chaired by Justice Lowell Goddard , said that although the allegations about Sir Edward fell within its terms of reference , it had not received any direct allegations . Sir Edward , who was Conservative prime minister from 1970 to 1974 , died aged 89 in 2005 at his home in Salisbury . Wiltshire Police has declined to comment on the claims that it did not follow up accusations against him during his lifetime , but has appealed for information regarding allegations against Sir Edward . Meanwhile , Labour MP Tom Watson said he had referred two allegations of child sexual abuse by Sir Edward to the police since 2012 , with police confirming that at least one of those allegations was being investigated . Friends of Sir Edward have dismissed the claims , saying there is not a sh@@ red of evidence to link him to abuse . The Sir Edward Heath Char@@ itable Foundation , which operates the museum at Ar@@ und@@ ells , his home in Salisbury , said it &quot; wholeheartedly &quot; believed the investigation would clear Sir Edward &apos;s name .

S-416	The currency initially slipped against the dollar and euro , only to start recovering in mid-@@ afternoon trading before falling again . Meanwhile , the &quot; volatility index &quot; - a measure of investors &apos; uncertainty - has hit levels last seen in the 2008 financial crisis . The Leave campaign argued that the pound simply retreated to March levels . The pound was down 0.2 % against the dollar at $ 1.4@@ 226 . Against the euro , sterling was down 0.6 % at â &apos; ¬ 1.@@ 26@@ 05 and weakened by 1 % against the Japanese yen to just over 151 . Investors have been spoo@@ ked by data showing the chances of a Remain vote have fallen , although markets have also been rattled by global economic worries . With 10 days to go before the referendum vote , two polls at the weekend put the Leave camp ahead , while betting firm Betfair said the implied probability of a vote to Remain had now fallen to 6@@ 8.5 % from almost 80 % a week earlier . How trade and the UK &apos;s economy are affected by membership of the EU . &quot; We expect incoming polls to move the pound more aggressively than before , &quot; said Char@@ al@@ am@@ bos P@@ iss@@ ou@@ ros , senior analyst at Iron@@ FX Global . &quot; If new polls continue to show a tight race between the two campaigns as we approach the voting day , the outcome is likely to become even more uncertain and hence , volatility in sterling is likely to heigh@@ ten further . &quot; BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed said hedge funds had been placing bets - short-@@ selling - on expectations that the value of sterling will sink further . &quot; The bears are in town , &quot; he said . Joe Run@@ dle , head of trading at ET@@ X Capital , said the markets were now on full Brexit alert . &quot; Polls show it &apos;s now too close to call and markets are responding with some very tw@@ itch@@ y activity . Sterling has shed more than 2 % in two sessions to re@@ trace its April lows . &quot; Wor@@ ries about the economic impact of leaving the EU were also blamed for a big fall in Asian stock markets . Japan &apos;s Nikkei index closed 3.5 % down , while Hong Kong &apos;s main index slid 2.5 % . The reaction on London &apos;s FTSE 100 was muted initially , with the index down 0.3 % in morning trading . However , the FTSE 100 ended the day down 1.1 % at 6,0@@ 4@@ 4.9 points , with Lloyds Banking Group the biggest faller , down 4.2 % . On Sunday , Leave campaigner Nigel Farage told BBC1 &apos;s Andrew Marr Show that sterling had recently been strengthening . &quot; Sterling is up since March . Since Brexit became a possibility , sterling is up and FTSE is exactly the same level it was in March , &quot; he said . He also pointed out that a weaker pound was good for UK exporters . Last week , official figures showed that the UK trade deficit narrowed in April on the back of a jump in exports .

S-107	Ms Evans , who is currently suspended from UKIP , said she would &quot; very much like &quot; to run but a &quot; handful of people at the top &quot; had ensured she could not . Ms Evans &apos; six-month ban for bringing the party into disrepute - claims she has dismissed - means she cannot stand . She said she would back councillor Lisa Duffy to succeed Nigel Farage . Ms Evans said UKIP needed to &quot; break free of its hard-@@ right image and set itself firmly in the common sense centre-@@ ground &quot; and also conduct some &quot; internal reform . &quot; The leadership contest has been prompted by Mr Farage &apos;s decision to stand down following the UK &apos;s vote to leave the European Union , saying his &quot; political ambition has been achieved . &quot; In a statement in Westminster , Ms Evans , who had been touted as a possible successor , said : &quot; I &apos;d very much like to run in that election . &quot; Unfortunately there are a handful of people at the top of UKIP who , for whatever personal reasons of their own , have made quite sure I can &apos;t . &quot; She claimed the party ru@@ le@@ book had been &quot; abused &quot; to suspend her to prevent her from representing the party in May &apos;s London Assembly elections and the upcoming leadership contest . Her six-month suspension handed down in March came after an internal disciplinary meeting found she had publicly criticised a fellow candidate and held herself out as a party spokeswoman without authority . Ms Evans - who has always rejected the claims against her - lost a High Court bid to overturn the decision . In the statement , she said : &quot; I have to face up to reality , there &apos;s no way they &apos;re going to allow me to put my name on the ballot paper ... I &apos;ve now given up hope of becoming the next leader of UKIP . &quot; Ms Evans said she had questioned whether to stay on in a party that &quot; allows , and arguably encourages senior figures to behave like this , &quot; but she said the support from members had made her &quot; more determined ever not to give up on UKIP . &quot; She also said that with the right leader , the &quot; sky was the limit for the party . &quot; En@@ dor@@ sing Lisa Duffy , a district councillor for Ramsey in Cambridgeshire , Ms Evans said she was &quot; the best chance &quot; UKIP had to &quot; change , to grow and to thrive . &quot; She said UKIP needed &quot; a clean break from the past &quot; to become more like a political party than &quot; just a rugby club on tour . &quot; Under Ms Duffy &apos;s leadership , she argued , the party would be &quot; more united and consensual . &quot; Prior to her suspension Ms Evans wrote UKIP &apos;s 2015 general election manifesto . She was axed from her policy role in the party in-@@ fighting which followed Mr Farage &apos;s &quot; un@@ resignation &quot; after the general election . Mr Farage has denied her ban was due to criticism of him .

S-293	Chechen Muslim clerics met on 3 April , two days after the paper &apos;s revelations , and said the report had insulted their faith and the dignity of Chechen men . &quot; Ret@@ ri@@ bution will catch up with the true instig@@ ators , wherever and whoever they are , &quot; their resolution said . Nov@@ aya Gazeta says it amounts to a call for &quot; reprisals against journalists . &quot; &quot; We urge the Russian authorities to do everything possible to prevent actions aimed at inciting hatred and en@@ m@@ ity towards journalists , who are doing their professional duty , &quot; the paper said . On 1 April it reported that more than 100 people had been detained in Chechnya on suspicion of being homosexual , and that at least three had been killed . The Russian LGBT Network , in touch with victims in Chechnya , told the BBC that the report was true . Hom@@ ophobia is rife in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus republic . Author@@ itarian leader Ram@@ zan Kadyrov is fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin . A spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Ar@@ gun , 20km ( 13 miles ) from the city of Gro@@ z@@ ny . &quot; All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay , &quot; said Natalia Po@@ pl@@ ev@@ skaya . Ram@@ zan Kadyrov has denied the allegations , calling them &quot; lies . &quot; His spokesman Alv@@ i Karimov said there were no gay people in Chechnya . The Chech@@ ens &apos; spiritual leader , Mu@@ fti Sal@@ ah@@ -@@ ha@@ ji Me@@ z@@ hi@@ ev , confirmed that &quot; retribution &quot; was part of the resolution adopted at the special Muslim meeting in Gro@@ z@@ ny on 3 April . &quot; There will be retribution ! &quot; he told the Russian news website R@@ BC . &quot; Allah will punish those who s@@ lan@@ dered the whole Chechen nation and Chechen Republic &apos;s clerics . &quot; Nov@@ aya Gazeta &apos;s 1 April report said the detainees included some influential Muslim clerics close to Mr Kadyrov , and two well-known Chechen TV presenters . In an open letter to the mu@@ fti , the paper &apos;s chief editor Dmitry Mur@@ at@@ ov said his journalists would continue investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya . &quot; We did not insult - nor had we the slightest intention to insult - the Chechen people , &quot; he wrote , urging dialogue . Chech@@ ens have been linked to two murders of Nov@@ aya Gazeta reporters who investigated crimes in Chechnya - Anna Pol@@ it@@ kov@@ skaya and Natalia Est@@ em@@ i@@ ro@@ va . But much remains unclear about those contract killings , and that of Boris Nemtsov , an opposition politician who was shot dead in Moscow in 2015 and also exposed corruption and organised crime in Chechnya . The LGBT Network says it is helping people to flee the persecution in Chechnya and accuses the Russian authorities of ignoring the abuses . If Russia fails to prosecute anyone , it says it will file a case at the International Criminal Court in The Hague .

S-215	He died at his home in Cambridge following an illness lasting several months , a statement on his website said . It added his funeral will be private , with a memorial service to be held at a later date . Hog@@ wood worked with many leading orchest@@ ras around the world and was considered one of the most influential expon@@ ents of the early-@@ music movement . The conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music ( A@@ AM ) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years . The A@@ AM also made more than 200 CDs , including the first-ever complete cycle of Moz@@ art symp@@ hon@@ ies on period instruments . Among his most famous recordings include the 1980 version of Han@@ del &apos;s Mes@@ siah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Wat@@ kinson , which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time . Hog@@ wood studied keyboard at Cambridge University with Rafael Pu@@ yana and Mary Potts and later with Z@@ uz@@ ana Ru@@ z@@ ick@@ ova and Gust@@ av Leon@@ hardt . His first positions were as a keyboard player and mus@@ ic@@ ologist with the Academy of Saint Martin@@ -in-@@ the-@@ Fields under Sir Neville Mar@@ rin@@ er , and was a founder member of the Early Music Con@@ sort of London . He was the artistic director of the King &apos;s Lynn Festival and Boston &apos;s Han@@ del and Haydn Society . He was also a tutor at Harvard University , honorary professor of music at the University of Cambridge and a prof@@ ess@@ or-@@ at-@@ large at Cornell University in the US . &quot; Christopher had extraordinary generosity of spirit , &quot; Christopher Purvis , honorary president of the A@@ AM , said . &quot; He was a great ambassador for historically informed music , the movement of which he was a founder . And he was happy to see the orchestra he founded develop and grow after he stepped down as director . &quot; The A@@ AM &apos;s music director Richard E@@ gar@@ r added : &quot; I am deeply saddened by the news of Christopher &apos;s passing . Christopher provided a fantastic legacy for me to build upon when I joined in 2006 and I know he will be greatly missed by all who knew and worked with him . &quot; Speaking to Sean Rafferty on Radio 3 &apos;s In T@@ une , sop@@ rano Dame Emma Kirkby said : &quot; Some of the best players that now lead orchest@@ ras all over the world , they started with him . &quot; Chris was a natural academic , an incredibly clever man . He had an amazing capacity to absorb information of all kinds and a really sure sense of how things would be if he really tried to reproduce conditions ... a very gen@@ ial person . &quot; David Thomas from Trinity Lab@@ an Conserv@@ at@@ o@@ ire of Music and Dance , London added : &quot; He always said I want the music to speak for itself because it can , it &apos;s good enough , it will@@ â € ¦ a very pleasant and lovely man . &quot;

S-161	Rakh@@ mat Ak@@ il@@ ov reportedly ran from the scene still covered in blood and glass , and was arrested hours later in a northern suburb of Stockholm . He has yet to be identified by police , who have only said that the man in custody is a 39-year-old Uzbek national . Even so , a picture of the man allegedly behind the attack has started to emerge : someone who had failed in his bid to get residency , lost his job and was hiding from police who wanted to deport him . B@@ umping into a former colleague earlier this year , he revealed he was spending his days &quot; sleeping and smoking . &quot; According to reports , he had left a wife and four children behind in Uzbekistan in order to earn money to send home . He had applied for residency in 2014 , but had been informed in December 2016 that &quot; he had four weeks to leave the country , &quot; police official Jonas Hy@@ sing said . He did not leave and , in February , was officially put on a wanted list . A few months earlier , it is claimed he had lost his job after falling asleep at work . He had been working in construction , and was employed by Pierre Sven@@ sson for several weeks late last year , helping on an asbestos removal project . Mr Ak@@ il@@ ov was , he said , &quot; a reserved person . &quot; &quot; He didn &apos;t stick out . He did his job . You can &apos;t say he was very sociable , we just told him what to do and he did it . He didn &apos;t speak much Swedish , &quot; he told news agency AFP . Mr Ak@@ il@@ ov was also described as not being particularly religious . One has suggested he &quot; parti@@ ed and drank , &quot; which goes against strict Islamic doctrine . &quot; He never talked about politics or religion , &quot; one friend told Swedish daily Af@@ ton@@ bl@@ ad@@ et . &quot; He didn &apos;t pray five times a day from what I know . &quot; A co-@@ worker agreed , telling news agency Reuters : &quot; He was like any normal guy . &quot; Online , it seems , it was a different story . His Facebook page - which has since been taken down - is linked to a number of extremists through friends and featured at least two propaganda videos linked to IS , one reportedly showing the aftermath of the Boston bombing . He also liked a page called &quot; Friends of Libya and Syria , &quot; which says it aims to expose &quot; terrorism of the imperi@@ alistic financial capitals &quot; of the US , British and Arab &quot; dictator@@ ships . &quot; However , he was also a fan of pages dedicated to Playboy magazine and Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova . Despite all this , Mr Ak@@ il@@ ov was not considered a threat by Swedish security services , who dismissed him as a &quot; marginal character , &quot; apparently on the fringes of larger extremist movements .

S-102	Women are as likely as men to ask for a pay rise - but are less likely to get one , the research found . The study , by the C@@ ass Business School and the universities of Warwick and Wisconsin , looked at 4,@@ 600 workers . It found &quot; no support &quot; for the &quot; re@@ tic@@ ent female &quot; theory , whereby women avoided asking for more money . For what it claimed was the first time , the study eliminated any impact from part-time workers earning less than their full-time counterparts , by comparing full-time males with full-time females , and part-time males with part-time females . When like-for-like male and female workers were compared , men were 25 % more likely to get a pay rise when they asked , the study found . The research also concluded there was no evidence for the idea that women were reluctant to ask for a salary increase because they were more wary of upsetting their boss , or devi@@ ating from a perceived female stereotype . When analysing the results , the researchers took into account the size of the employer and the industry , whether the workers were a parent , as well as their qualifications . The study was based on data from the 2013-14 Australian workplace relations survey . Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise , and why they had or had not done so . Andrew Oswald , professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick , said he was surprised by the findings . &quot; The fact that women don &apos;t ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory . It &apos;s a very common thing for women to say and believe , but all of the evidence is anecdotal , so it &apos;s very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this . &quot; He said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise , but did not get it , kept it to themselves , while women &quot; were more straightforward and tell their friends . &quot; &quot; Having seen these findings , I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women , &quot; Prof Oswald added . &quot; It could be that Australia is odd . But it &apos;s a modern industrial economy halfway in character between Britain and the US , so I think that &apos;s unlikely . &quot; The study also found differences according to age , with women and men under 40 both asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate , which the researchers said could mean that negotiating behaviour had started to change . Dr Amanda Goodall from C@@ ass Business School - part of City , University of London - and a co-author of the study , said : &quot; The study potentially has an upside . Young women today are negotiating their pay and conditions more successfully than older females , and perhaps that will continue as they become more senior . &quot;

S-219	Although there is some common ground between the two governments on , for example , the need for free trade within the single market , Carwyn Jones has complained that he didn &apos;t see the letter before it was published on Wednesday . ( He has that in common with most of Mrs May &apos;s cabinet ) . The first minister told AMs : &quot; I discussed the Article 50 letter in general terms with the prime minister when we met in Swansea last week . &quot; I should be clear , though , that I didn &apos;t see the letter before today and we were not invited to contribute to its drafting . This is unacceptable and is the culmination of a deeply frustrating process in which the devolved administrations have persistently been treated with a lack of respect . &quot; It is all the more regrettable given the UK government &apos;s stated aim was to develop a negotiating framework for the whole of the UK . &quot; Mr Jones may have been playing to an audience , but Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns hit back : &quot; I &apos;m a bit disappointed in that . The prime minister has been in Wales three times in the last six weeks . &quot; We &apos;ve been talking about the contents of this letter for many months . &quot; We &apos;ve clearly all made our representations but , ultimately , the UK government needs to act in the interests of the whole of the UK and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , specifically with Wales being mentioned . &quot; Mrs May did indeed mention Wales in the letter . She told Donald Tusk : &quot; When it comes to the return of powers back to the United Kingdom , we will consult fully on which powers should reside in Westminster and which should be devolved to Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland . &quot; But it is the expectation of the government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration . &quot; That sentence may have been written more with Scotland in mind , but it does prompt the question : which powers ? Farming ? Economic aid ? And will the money follow the powers ? Alun Cairns wouldn &apos;t answer those questions , although Carwyn Jones has said he fears there won &apos;t be any money to accompany the powers after 2020 . ( Perhaps Mr Jones doesn &apos;t think Jeremy Corbyn will win power that year - Labour has pledged to maintain EU funding levels on regional aid beyond 2020 ) . Some in Whitehall think the way EU money has been spent in Wales - check out Nick Clegg &apos;s film from Ebbw Vale - is an argument for transferring those powers to Westminster , but that looks politically less likely now . We may get some more details about the process in a white paper on the Great Repeal Bill on Thursday but , at the moment , the identity of the powers the UK government wants to see devolved is something of a mystery .

S-179	At the end of his speech launching the party &apos;s manifesto , Mike Nesbitt said : &quot; Domin@@ ation doesn &apos;t work , partnership does . &quot; Ulster Unionists want the election to be a referendum on how the Renewable Heat Incentive debacle was handled . But the focus has now turned on them following Mr Nesbitt &apos;s comments . Mr Nesbitt was asked about the decision of his senior party colleague Danny Kennedy to publicly distance himself from the remarks . He turned to Mr Kennedy , who was sitting behind him on the platform , and said : &quot; It wasn &apos;t disappointing , it was actually quite reaffir@@ ming to know Danny was listening . &quot; The line brought laughter from other candidates and party members . Under questioning from journalists , Mr Nesbitt denied that he had any regrets or that he had made a mistake . &quot; What I have said consistently is vote Ulster Unionists and then for any candidate that you believe will do the right thing within your community , within your constituency and within the country , &quot; he said . He added that he &quot; wouldn &apos;t withdraw a word &quot; of what he had said and was thinking only of what what would happen after the election . &quot; The fact is , if we are going into &#91; Stormont &#93; Castle , it will be with a nationalist party , &quot; he said . &quot; Now , would I rather go in with Sinn FÃ © in or the SDLP ? I would rather go in with the SDLP . &quot; Mr Nesbitt went on to say that , on Monday , he spent a lot of time time knocking doors in heavily unionist areas with &quot; very little criticism and a lot of support for what I was talking about . &quot; &quot; I am confident in my position and I &apos;m very confident and relaxed that &#91; candidates &#93; behind me are taking different positions in terms of vote transfer , &quot; he said . &quot; But people will come back on 2 March to thinking about the Â £ 85,000 a day that is going up in smoke , the 10 years of the DUP and Sin FÃ © in in that castle and the im@@ possibility , no matter what anybody writes in a platform piece for the newspaper , of leopards changing their spots . &quot; The manifesto , entitled &apos; Real Partnership &apos; , includes calls for action in tackling waiting lists , increasing PSNI numbers to 7,500 , prioritising the York Street interchange , standing up for the LGBT community and &quot; guaranteeing &quot; that no group is worse off because of Brexit . In a section entitled &apos; Cle@@ aning Up Stormont &apos; , the party calls for : On the theme of the election being a referendum , he said it was about &quot; incompetence , arrogance , cronyism and the strong whiff of corruption . &quot; He must hope that message will resonate more strongly than the continuing controversy over his remarks about transferring to the SDLP .

S-184	Defence att@@ ach@@ é Capt Oleg Kor@@ ni@@ enko presented U@@ sha@@ kov medals to the men of the Arctic Con@@ voys . A@@ ble sea@@ man Charles Lewis , 91 , from Cal@@ more , Hampshire said he was &quot; honoured and delighted . &quot; The Foreign Office initially did not allow Russia to honour the veterans as it broke the rules on foreign medals . The Russian embassy said the convoys allowed Russian soldiers to defeat the Germans on the Eastern Front . Mr Lewis said : &quot; I certainly don &apos;t see myself as a hero - far from it - and I think all my friends and colleagues , many of whom sadly are no longer with us , would regard us as simply doing our bit for the war effort . &quot; Although I have to say that Churchill &apos;s famous quote about the Arctic convoys &apos; missions through the North Sea in winter as being &apos; the worst journey on earth &apos; did strike a chord - then and now . &quot; • They consisted of vessels which travelled from Britain to northern Russia to re@@ supply the Soviet Union during World War II • Under constant threat of attack by German U-@@ boats and aircraft , the craft also had to deal with severe cold , storms , and ice flo@@ es • By May 1945 , the Arctic route had claimed 104 merchant and 16 military vessels . Thousands of Allied sea@@ men lost their lives Source : National Maritime Museum Minist@@ er-@@ Councillor Alexander Kram@@ aren@@ ko from the Russian Embassy said : &quot; It &#91; the ceremony &#93; is done for them because they have been expecting for a very long time to be recogni@@ zed . &quot; It is done for us as it was important for us . &quot; The ar@@ ctic convoy was a material expression of our wartime alliance and they provided weapons and ammunition that armed us to defeat the Germans on the Eastern front . &quot; We and Britain were in it together . &quot; More than 3,000 men died during the maritime campaign that Winston Churchill was said to have called the &quot; worst journey in the world . &quot; The Russian Embassy wrote to survivors in May 2012 that it intended to award them with the Medal of U@@ sha@@ kov as a symbol of the country &apos;s gratitude . But the move was blocked by the Foreign Office as its rules stated British soldiers could not receive a foreign medal if the act happened more than five years ago . The British Government created the Arctic Star in 2012 following a long campaign for the convoy veterans to be recognised . But campaigners believed veterans should still be able to receive the Russian accolade . The Foreign Office allowed an &quot; exception to the rules &quot; last year and President Vladimir Putin presented the first medals during his visit to London on 16 June 2013 . The U@@ sha@@ kov medal is awarded to sailors who have displayed courage in the course of defending Russia or its interests .

S-153	Denise Fergus said she had been &quot; let down so many times by the system &quot; but that she would continue to &quot; fight . &quot; Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were convicted of killing two-year-old James in Bootle , Merseyside in 1993 . Mrs Fergus said she believed Venables was capable of harming other people if he was released from prison . He was recalled to prison in 2010 . He had been released from prison in 2001 , having served seven years of a life sentence , but was recalled when he pleaded guilty to downloading and distributing indecent images of children . Mrs Fergus , speaking to the BBC to mark the 20th anniversary of the killing , said : &quot; Do not release him . I still don &apos;t think he &apos;s capable of walking amongst other people . &quot; He will do someone else harm . It &apos;s in him , and I strongly believe if he &apos;s released he will go on to hurt someone else . &quot; Thompson , who was also released in 2001 after eight years in detention , was given a new secret identity and address . Venables was aged 10 when he and Thompson abducted and murdered James , beating him with bricks and iron bars and leaving his body on a railway line . James &apos; mother described it as &quot; a stupid , silly little mistake &quot; of hers to let go of her child &apos;s hand for a few seconds on 12 February 1993 at the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle . She said it &quot; still feels so raw to this day . &quot; &quot; I still can &apos;t understand how it happened , or why it happened . &quot; Mrs Fergus set up a charity , named after her son , to support young people who have become the victims of crime , hatred or bullying . Asked if , after 20 years , she should move on , Mrs Fergus said : &quot; Why should I let it go ? They took the most precious thing away from me . I won &apos;t let it go . And I &apos;ve always said if there &apos;s a fight there to be fought , then I &apos;ll fight it for James . &quot; If I let go of that now I will feel I &apos;ve let James down . That is something I &apos;ll never do , I &apos;ll never let James down . I want justice for James . He &apos;s never had justice . &quot; She has campaigned to have both men kept in prison , and said : &quot; I did warn &#91; the authorities &#93; that one of them or both of them would go on to re@@ offend , and I was proven right with Venables . &quot; She said her family - her husband and three sons - mention James often . &quot; I think the day I stop talking about him is the day I give up on life , but I &apos;ll never stop talking about him , never stop remembering him . &quot;

S-315	All glass and concrete beside a fast-@@ flowing stream , the Longford Town Centre was to be a cathedral of commerce - now it stands as a monument to the end of the Celtic Tiger and the Republic of Ireland &apos;s economic crash and burn . But local traders believe the bad times are slowly changing . Matt O &apos;Brien runs a family-@@ owned men &apos;s clothing shop in the town centre . Recent years have been bad - 30 % down on the boom - with a member of staff having to be laid off . But he can now see a turnaround . &quot; Over the last year we &apos;ve noticed that business has increased , although it was coming from a low base , but we have improved , &quot; he says . &quot; We &apos;ve done extra things to try to improve things . We &apos;ve got into child@@ ren@@ swear and we do a very substantial dres@@ s-@@ hire business . We &apos;ve bran@@ ched out into other areas , which have helped us . &quot; Fianna FÃ ¡ il , the main opposition party , is highly critical of how the Fine Ga@@ el-@@ Labour coalition is dealing with the mid@@ lands , arguing that the half-@@ a-@@ billion euro investment in water meters that won &apos;t be operational for several years should instead be spent on broadband improvement . Its local TD Robert Troy accuses the government of negligence and says a targeted approach is needed for the area . &quot; The Industrial Development Authority ( I@@ DA ) haven &apos;t brought one potential client to Longford in over four years , &quot; he says . &quot; And if the I@@ DA , which is charged with bringing foreign direct investment to the regions , isn &apos;t marketing Longford , isn &apos;t showing Longford to potential clients , how then can we expect foreign direct investment to come to Longford ? &quot; But the government says it is doing its bit for County Longford , with the recent announcement that holiday company Center Par@@ cs hopes to employ about 1,000 people at its planned tourism development in Bally@@ ma@@ hon in the county when it opens in 2019 . However , the proposed 200m euro ( Â £ 14@@ 6m ) centre in 340 acres of wooded area still has to get planning permission . Nevertheless , James Bannon , the local Fine Gael TD , is confident the venture will be a success . He says : &quot; The mid@@ lands has some of the finest scenery and water@@ sports that you could avail of anywhere in the world . &quot; You have the Shannon , just three miles from here you have the River In@@ ny , you have the Royal Canal , you have huge infrastructure here and we &apos;re always open for new tourists to come in to this area . &quot; The Center Par@@ cs announcement will not harm the government &apos;s chances in next year &apos;s expected general election , but traders like Matt O &apos;Brien believe more could be done to boost local business . &quot; At the moment a lot of people are unhappy at paying for parking on the street , &quot; he says . &quot; Some of our neighbouring towns don &apos;t have parking charges . There are issues with the council and if we had free parking it would help bring more people into the town . &quot; So , the message coming from the mid@@ lands is that while it , too , is starting to see the beginnings of an economic recovery more still needs to be done .

S-301	The paper ran a front page headline calling the comedian a &quot; hyp@@ ocr@@ ite &quot; because he campaigns for economic and political &quot; revolution &quot; to help poorer people , yet he lives in a luxury home . It &apos;s an accusation often made against the star . How can such a rich man claim to speak up for the poor ? Viewers of Brand &apos;s v@@ logs - The Tre@@ ws - are familiar with the inside of his spac@@ ious London home . It looks lovely and airy . It has wooden floors and exposed brick@@ work . When the St Trin@@ ian &apos;s star was outside the prime minister &apos;s Downing Street home - supporting a campaign by residents of an east London estate who fear they will be tur@@ fed out of their homes to allow richer renters to move in - Brand was asked about his own accommodation by a TV reporter . &quot; Part of the problem is the super-@@ rich buying property in London , isn &apos;t it ? What kind of rent are you paying ? &quot; Brand wasn &apos;t very happy with the question . He called the Channel 4 News journalist &quot; a sn@@ ide , &quot; before walking off . Newsbeat contacted Brand to see if he was really going to take legal action against The Sun and its owner Rupert Murdoch . He didn &apos;t reply , though he has been tweeting about The Sun and it &apos;s accusations of hypocrisy - using the hashtag # The@@ Sun@@ Lo@@ gic . The star &apos;s been condemned as a hyp@@ ocr@@ ite plenty of times before . Here &apos;s how he &apos;s explained it in the past . &quot; Don &apos;t think I &apos;m unaware of the inevitability of such a charge . I know , I know . I &apos;m rich , I &apos;m famous , I have money ... There is no doubt that I as much as anyone have to change . &quot; Revolution is change . I believe in change , personal change most of all . Know , too that I have seen what fame and fortune have to offer and I know it &apos;s not the answer . &quot; Of course I have to change as an individual and part of that will be sharing wealth , though without systemic change , that will be a sweet , futile gesture . &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t deny that I &apos;ve done a lot of daft things while I was under the capitalist fu@@ gue , some silly telly , sop@@ py scandals , movies better left un@@ made . &quot; It &apos;s easy to attack me , I &apos;m a right twer@@ p , I &apos;m a jun@@ kie and a cheeky monkey , I accept it , but that doesn &apos;t detract from the in@@ contro@@ ver@@ tible fact that we are living in a time of huge economic disparity and confronting ecological disaster . &quot; &quot; Now I &apos;m rich and I complain about inequality they say I &apos;m a hyp@@ ocr@@ ite . I &apos;m beginning to think they just don &apos;t want inequality on the agenda because it is a real problem that needs to be addressed . &quot; &quot; A system that has pos@@ ited me on a l@@ ilo made of th@@ igh@@ s in an ocean filled with honey and fo@@ ie gr@@ as &apos;d my Essex ar@@ se with undue praise and money . &quot; The hypocrisy ... is a problem that can be taken care of increm@@ entally . &quot; Follow @ BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube

S-190	The oil painting was commissioned by Royal Northern S@@ inf@@ onia , which wants to challenge the Austrian &apos;s &quot; chocolate box &quot; portrayal , ahead its new season . &quot; Somehow we &apos;ve come to think of his music as pretty , &quot; said the orchestra &apos;s music director Lars Vog@@ t . &quot; But that music is often dramatic and dark . Those qualities must have been there in the man . &quot; The portrait was painted by renowned American artist Tim O &apos;Brien , and will be projected onto buildings around the orchestra &apos;s home towns of Newcastle and Gateshead over the coming months . Regar@@ ded as one of the greatest composers of all time , Moz@@ art wrote more than 600 works , including some of the most celebrated and enduring pieces of classical music , before he died at the age of 35 . Only 14 images of the composer are known to have been created during his lifetime , but many are styl@@ ised or incomplete . The best physical description came from bar@@ it@@ one Lu@@ igi B@@ assi , for whom Moz@@ art had written the role of Don Giovanni . &quot; Mr Moz@@ art was an extremely eccentric and absent@@ -minded young man , but not without a certain spirit of pride , &quot; he said . &quot; He was very popular with the ladies , in spite of his small size ; but he had a most unusual face , and he could cast a spell on any woman with his eyes . &quot; Describing the existing portraits as &quot; cosy and pretty , &quot; O &apos;Brien explained the thinking behind his new painting . &quot; I know of few musicians of real depth where you can &apos;t see some of that complexity in the face . So to find the Moz@@ art who was obs@@ essively driven , who pushed boundaries and who lived in a world where harsh poverty and crime were a very real facts , I looked at musicians from our own era to provide some inspiration . &quot; Photos of Johnny Cash and Eric Clap@@ ton suggested both obsession and some kind of danger . Johnny R@@ otten provided a certain pre@@ co@@ cious brilliance , and I related to those for Moz@@ art . &quot; O &apos;Brien previously made headlines by creating a portrait of Beethoven for the cover of Gram@@ oph@@ one magazine , which was inspired by U2 singer Bono . The portrait ac@@ companies the Northern S@@ inf@@ onia &apos;s new season , which includes a series of concerts called Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing Moz@@ art . They begin on Friday , 18 September with the first movement of Moz@@ art &apos;s Symphony No@@ . 25 , and will also include his Clar@@ inet Concer@@ to and the rarely performed Symphony No@@ . 33 . Musical director Vog@@ t will be the sol@@ o@@ ist in the Quint@@ et for Pi@@ ano and Wind , of which Moz@@ art once wrote : &quot; I myself consider it to be the best thing I have written in my life . &quot; The German concert pianist and conductor , who recently played the first night of the Proms , is an av@@ owed Moz@@ art fan - whose desert island disc would be a box set of the composer &apos;s works . In his first season as director of the S@@ inf@@ onia , he plans to stage a number of &quot; pop-up &quot; concerts in venues that echo the &quot; darker corners of Vienna &quot; that Moz@@ art would have frequ@@ ented in the 18th Century .

S-433	Media playback is not supported on this device But the Uruguay striker , 27 , can now train and play in friendly matches , with new club Barcelona confirming : &quot; He will join the first team &apos;s training session , scheduled for Friday . &quot; The public presentation of Suarez as a new Barcelona player will be held on Monday at the Camp Nou . &quot; It is not known if he will play in Monday &apos;s game with Mexico &apos;s Club Leon . A full explanation of the Cas ruling , which still prevents him from playing &quot; organised &quot; matches but now allows him to take part in all &quot; football-related activities , &quot; will be published at a later date . He will still have to serve the remaining eight games of his record nine-@@ match ban in competitive international games , while his competitive Barcelona debut is likely to be at Real Madrid on 26 October in El Clasico . But Suarez will now be available for Uruguay &apos;s friendlies against Japan and South Korea in September and Saudi Arabia the following month . Suarez &apos;s lawyers argued that world governing body Fifa &apos;s decision to suspend him from all football-related activity for biting Italy &apos;s Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay &apos;s 2014 World Cup group match in Brazil in June was too strong a punishment . Switzer@@ land-based Cas - an independent body whose rulings are accepted by most sporting organisations - said : &quot; The sanctions imposed on the player by Fifa have been generally confirmed . &quot; But it said preventing Suarez from taking part in any football activity was &quot; excessive , &quot; as not allowing him to train would have an impact on the player after the suspension had ended . World players &apos; union Fif@@ pro said it was &quot; disappointed that the court had decided not to strongly diminish the sanctions &quot; and &quot; remain of the view they are disproportionate in relation to his violation of the Fifa disciplinary code . &quot; It added : &quot; We regret Cas not deciding to reduce the length of Suarez &apos;s bans in exchange for an obligation for him to receive treatment . &quot; In addition to being allowed to train and play in friendlies , the former Liverpool player - who moved to Barcelona last month for £ 75m - can also attend matches and take part in promotional activities . His legal team said the appeal was a success , arguing Fifa had &quot; mis@@ applied its own rules when considering the case and the sanction it imposed was disproportionate . &quot; Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted : &quot; Luis Suarez &apos;s appeal against a four-month ban has failed . He is though , sensibly I think , now allowed to train with the team . &quot; &quot; By allowing Suarez to train , Cas appears to have taken into account the club &apos;s interests and has emphasised any appropriate sanction for such incidents should be proportionate , &quot; said Hannah C@@ lip@@ ston , a lawyer specialising in resolving disputes . &quot; What is proportionate for a repeat offender is different to what is proportionate for a first time offender . &quot; Suarez apologised nearly a week after the incident , despite initially claiming to have lost his balance . He was previously suspended for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Ot@@ man Bak@@ k@@ al and Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic . In 2011 , he was also given an eight-@@ match suspension and fined £ 40,000 for racially abusing Manchester United &apos;s Patrice Evra .

England made 58@@ 9-8 declared and 17@@ 3-1 declared to set up their second biggest win over Pakistan in terms of runs . &quot; It &apos;s an absolute hammering . It &apos;s as good a four days of cricket that you could wish for from an England point of view , &quot; Vaughan told Test Match Special . England &apos;s Joe Root , promoted to number three for this series , was named man of the match after scoring 254 in the first innings and an unbeaten 71 off 48 balls in the second . He also took four catches in Pakistan &apos;s first-innings 198 and claimed a wicket in his only over as Pakistan were bowled out for 234 on Monday . &quot; It &apos;s great to see him stepping up to number three and playing with the responsibility there , &quot; said captain Alastair Cook , who made 105 and 76 not out . &quot; It &apos;s as good an innings as I &apos;ve seen . He &apos;s an extraordinary player . He didn &apos;t put a foot wrong ; he played beautifully . &quot; Root , who twice fell to poor strokes in England &apos;s 75-@@ run defeat in the first Test , said : &quot; It &apos;s a great feeling . &quot; Those two occasions at Lord &apos;s were batsman error on my part . I tried to cut that out of my game . It &apos;s the most controlled I &apos;ve played . &quot; Coach Trevor Bayliss said : &quot; He went away and did a bit of soul-@@ searching and hard work , came back and did exactly what he said he was going to do . &quot; Vaughan : added : &quot; This was his best T@@ est-@@ match innings . &quot; Media playback is not supported on this device Pakistan batted for only 63 overs in the first innings and 70 in the second on a pitch that offered the bowlers little assistance . &quot; Their spirit was broken , &quot; said former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott . &quot; Full marks to England - they got it all together , the quality of the batting , the discipline , their good bowling . &quot; England are in a good place and will win again . They will be too strong for Pakistan . I &apos;ll be surprised if they come back . &quot; Pakistan play a two-day tour game against Worcestershire at New Road starting on Friday before the third Test at Edgbaston gets under way on 3 August .

S-122	As Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed in their first one-on-one debate it was the senator from Vermont who started to trend worldwide . So what are Bernie &apos;s supporters doing differently to bolster his support amongst younger voters ? One place where he is a surprising hit is the dating app Tinder . Kevin Sm@@ it from Alk@@ ma@@ ar in the Netherlands has used Tinder to spread the Bernie gospel . &quot; I &apos;m not a heterosexual male and I too believe he &apos;s sexy &quot; he joked to BBC News . &quot; He &apos;s a hit because there &apos;s a lot of millennials on the app and he polls amazingly with them . &quot; Fans of Bernie &apos;s Tinder triumphs share their success on Facebook and Tumblr . Logan Jan@@ t@@ zi from New York told BBC News that it was Bernie &apos;s policies which lead to his Tinder appeal . &quot; He discusses problems that are of actual concern to young voters &quot; he said . &quot; Gender inequality , low wages , high student loan debt , climate change , these are the things that 18-@@ 30 some@@ things are concerned with . &quot; Nelson Evans , a Bernie Sanders supporter from California , told BBC News that the popularity of Bernie on social media was because his supporters didn &apos;t think their candidate received enough attention in traditional media . &quot; There &apos;s people who even pay the full Tinder membership fees in order to reach others across the country &quot; he said . &quot; I think it &apos;s effective because , prior to the Iowa caucus , the media has completely shut Bernie out of the news cycle . For every 81 minutes of election coverage he &apos;d get 10 seconds and Bernie supporters know that . &quot; &quot; But people who get their election news from the mainstream media , they have no idea what Bernie is all about . That &apos;s sort of what started the Tinder thing . &quot; It &apos;s amazing how you see people from 17-@@ 29 who have gone from never being interested in politics to being completely envelop@@ ed by it . &quot; This election represents more than just a candidate . It &apos;s an indication that the youth know what direction they want our country to go , and they &apos;re ready to work vigorously for it , &quot; he added . The hashtag # dem@@ debate has been used more than 600,000 times over the past 24 hours to discuss the debate between Clinton and Sanders : Both candidates have their names shortened on Twitter to fit with the platform &apos;s character limit . Hillary Clinton is commonly called &apos; # HRC &apos; by supporters , a term which has featured in more than 4@@ 9,@@ 700 tweets over the past 24 hours while the term # Bernie far surpassed that and was used in 3@@ 22,000 tweets . On Facebook , Bernie Sanders &apos; personal page has almost three million likes while Hillary Clinton is only able to manage 2.3 million . But his popularity on social sites won &apos;t necessarily translate into Bernie Sanders becoming the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination . Left-@@ leaning young voters in the UK frequently made the Labour leader Ed Miliband the top trend on Twitter and other social sites during last year &apos;s general election , as part of the hashtag # mil@@ if@@ and@@ om campaign . Unfortunately for him , his online fans did not turn into a majority in voting stations last May .

S-30	It was easy to do she says , because of Britain being inside the European Union . She has already sent off her postal vote : she voted to stay in . It wasn &apos;t just the weather that made the Steven@@ sons leave the UK . Their cleaning business was in trouble because it was being undercut by companies run by Polish migrants . But so what , Nigel says . He thinks British people need to &quot; up their game &quot; and stop complaining about immigration . &quot; They have had it too easy for too long &quot; , he says . Nigel will also be voting for Remain . Exp@@ ats urged to register for EU vote The UK &apos;s EU vote : All you need to know UK and the EU : Travel and living abroad S@@ it on the sea wall by their caf@@ Ã © and you &apos;ll struggle to hear much Spanish conversation . Almost everyone walking by is either a British tourist or resident . There are 30@@ 9,000 Brits registered as having residency in Spain but there are likely to be many thousands more living here for just part of the year . S@@ at at one of the caf@@ Ã © &apos; s tables is Scotsman Mark Connor . A singer and radio DJ , he performs at a nearby Irish bar . He has been paying close attention to the referendum debate and is annoyed by some of the arguments being put forward by the Remain side . In particular he is irritated at the suggestion that if Britain leaves , the Spanish government could make it harder to live and work here . The Spanish wouldn &apos;t dare make it harder for Brits he says because they contribute so much to the economy . &apos; &quot; The pensioners have their own UK pensions so they &apos;re not a drain on the state , &quot; Mark tells me . &quot; And then there are all the well-off Brits living up in the hills and down at the marina , are you seriously telling me that the Spanish are going to get rid of them ? I don &apos;t think so . &quot; A few miles away is a community known as Little Britain . It is not hard to understand why . There is a fish and chip shop , British Butcher &apos;s , Chinese and Indian Restaur@@ ants , an Iceland close by , and of course , full English Break@@ fast@@ s a-@@ go-@@ go . At its heart is the Ben@@ avi@@ sta Bowls Club . Almost all of the club &apos;s 150 members are British and they are mostly retired . There has been speculation that they could be hit financially , that their UK pensions could be frozen because that is what has happened to expats in some non-EU countries . Lar@@ gest number of Brits living in EU countries , according to Migration Watch . There have also been warnings that the Spanish government could start charging them for their healthcare . Speaking to members after the match it was striking how many wanted to get out of the EU and how few had thought about how they might be affected financially . Whilst one couple worried about their pensions , the others did not seem particularly bothered about being charged for health care ; almost all of them had private health insurance . John Richardson , summed up the mood best . &quot; Oh , they &apos;ll sort something out &quot; .

S-367	Media playback is not supported on this device Benteke becomes the Reds &apos; second most expensive signing , on what the club describe as a &quot; long-term contract . &quot; Liverpool , who last week sold forward Raheem Sterling to Manchester City for £ 49m , triggered a release clause in Benteke &apos;s contract to make the 24-year-old their seventh summer signing . Belgium international Benteke scored 49 goals in 101 games for Villa after signing from Gen@@ k for £ 7m in 2012 . He told the Liverpool website : &quot; I &apos;m very happy to be here . I came here to win trophies . I came here to reach some great goals with the team . &quot; It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project . &quot; Liverpool struggled for goals last season following the £ 75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and prolonged injury absences for England international Daniel Sturridge as they finished sixth in the Premier League . Sig@@ nings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert produced three league goals and , after acknowledging the lack of scoring last season , manager Brendan Rodgers has added Benteke to revive the Reds &apos; attack . Liverpool have also signed forwards Danny Ings from Burnley and Brazil international Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim , while Benteke &apos;s international team-mate Divock Origi has returned to the club after spending last season on loan at Lille . Benteke missed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with an Achilles tendon injury but returned to action last October and scored 15 times to help Villa stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final . Former Villa manager Paul Lambert , who brought Benteke into English football , believes he will do well at Anfield . Lambert told BBC Sport : &quot; He &apos;s a brilliant number nine . He won &apos;t need just crosses to come into the box . If he gets the service he &apos;ll get goals . &quot; That &apos;s the type of guy he is and on his game he &apos;s a handful . I &apos;m delighted for him . He &apos;s earned that move and if he can do what I think he can do , he &apos;ll do great for them . &quot; He &apos;s going to have to handle the expectancy level of winning &#91; at Liverpool &#93; . When you speak to Christian , he has a great belief in himself to do well . &quot; Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge is also excited to see Benteke lead the Liverpool forward line , telling BBC Radio 5 live : &quot; He gives something different , a massive presence up front . &quot; It &apos;s a fall@@ acy when people say he doesn &apos;t play the Liverpool way . He knocked Liverpool out of the semi-final of the FA Cup when he played through the middle . &quot; He &apos;s very quick , very strong , very aggressive and that &apos;s something we haven &apos;t had for some time up front . It &apos;s something I &apos;m really happy with and I think he &apos;ll bring a lot to the squad . &quot; I &apos;m a lot more optimistic than I was this time last year . The strikers only scored eight goals last year , we can only do better than that going forward . &quot; Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page .

S-353	Up to a million people still needed to complete their tax credit renew@@ als in the final week before the deadline . They would have received information about their annual review notice in a white A4 envelope , but they can renew online up until Sunday night . Separately , many of those in the self-@@ assessment system must pay a tax bill . This so-called payment on account is the equivalent of half the previous year &apos;s tax bill , as an advance payment on their next bill . The other half is paid on 31 January . HM Revenue and Customs ( HMRC ) warned that anyone who failed to renew their tax credits could be in danger of having payments stopped , or find themselves paying more than they needed to . &quot; It is great that millions of people have renewed their tax credits or reported changes so far , but anyone who has not done so yet should take action now - it only takes a few minutes to renew online , &quot; said Nick Lodge , of HMRC . Renew@@ als can now also be completed via smartphone apps . The tax credit helpline - 0@@ 3@@ 45 300@@ 3@@ 900 - is open until 20 : 00 BST on Saturday and Sunday . To renew , they will need their renewal pack , their National Insurance number , their and their partners total income for the tax year to April 2016 , the 15-@@ digit number on their renewal pack , and details of any changes to their circumstances , such as working hours and children . Claim@@ ants who received notices in a brown A5 envelope will see their tax credits renewed automatically and are only required to contact HMRC if they need to make any correc@@ tions or notify HMRC of any changes to household circumstances . Those whose notices came in a white A4 envelope must renew , even if their circumstances have not changed . The tax payment deadline affects everyone in the self-@@ assessment system unless : There are various ways of paying but those leaving it to the weekend are likely to be limited to paying via online or telephone banking , or via the HMRC website using a debit or credit card . Interest is charged if the payment deadline is missed . After 28 days without payment , following the deadline , a surcharge is 5 % of any unpaid tax is levied . This surcharge is repeated after six months . &quot; This is a massive amount given the era of near zero interest rates , &quot; said C@@ has Ro@@ y-@@ Chowdhury , head of taxation at A@@ CC@@ A accountancy body . An HMRC spokesman pointed out that there was some wri@@ ggle room for those who contact HMRC if they are struggling to pay the tax owed . &quot; If a taxpayer can &apos;t pay and calls us before the due date and we agree a time to pay arrangement , they will not incur a surcharge , &quot; he said . &quot; Our reasoning being the taxpayer is making an effort and it would not be fair to hit them with a surcharge , where a time to pay arrangement is in place . &quot; HMRC has been criticised by MPs and the National Audit Office for waiting times for those trying to call at key times , but the tax authority said the service had now improved .

S-90	Pop Rec@@ s Ltd hosted in-@@ store gigs by acts from Franz Ferdinand to James Bay . It also earned the group an award for Britain &apos;s har@@ de@@ st-@@ working band from the Association of Independent Music . Drum@@ mer Dave Harper , who runs the shop , is now looking for a new site . &quot; We need to be somewhere else , &quot; he said . &quot; Not existing is not an option . &quot; The band opened Pop Rec@@ s Ltd to sell their own album in 2013 after realising there were few brick@@ s-@@ and-@@ mortar stores left to sell it . Hou@@ sed in the city &apos;s former tourist information office , it was originally only meant to be open for a few weeks . But the band kept it going and their DIY attempts to buck a music industry decline gained support from other independent artists . It also became a community hub , hosting regular music tuition plus poetry , stit@@ ching and toddler groups . Now , however , they have moved out after Sunderland City Council , which owned the building , sold it for student flats . Pul@@ led Apart By Horses played the shop &apos;s final gig on Saturday . Harper said he was looking at one possible new premises , and that comments from the shop &apos;s regulars had made him realise it was important to reopen . Things like the poetry group , which has 40 members , and the Saturday morning &quot; stit@@ ch and b@@ itch , &quot; will &quot; stop happening here , &quot; Harper said . &quot; That &apos;s absolutely terrifying because , if you walk around this city , and if you don &apos;t want baked pa@@ stry goods or go to a charity shop or cash a cheque or put a bet on , I don &apos;t know what people do . &quot; I &apos;m standing here with gre@@ ase on my hands and I hadn &apos;t cried for years until I realised this place was done , and people were saying pleasant things about it . It &apos;s really driven home so acutely what this place has meant to people . &quot; Members of shop &apos;s the regular meetings have told him that the groups help with their mental health problems , he said . &quot; They feel comfortable here and they don &apos;t feel comfortable anywhere else that &apos;s state sponsored or medication related , &quot; he said . &quot; I didn &apos;t know we were doing this . &quot; People have just come and told us recently , and that was in@@ finitely more upsetting , yet satisfying , that we were achieving things we didn &apos;t even realise under our own noses . &quot; The band have always known the council was trying to sell the building , Sunderland City Council &apos;s cabinet secretary Councillor Mel Spe@@ ding said . &quot; That has now been secured with its development into student accommodation . &quot; This is in line with council objectives to see more people living and working in the city centre and , in the interests of council tax payers in these financially challenging times for local authorities , it secures a capital receipt . &quot; Naturally , with the success and popularity of Pop Rec@@ s , the council and others have been looking at ways and means of continuing and securing a similar venture elsewhere in the city centre . &quot;

S-178	No demos on the streets of Athens - even though the Syriza government is poised to agree and implement yet more austerity and liberalisation measures , mandated by creditors and of the ilk that till recently it characterised as hateful . And Greece &apos;s resorts are te@@ eming : Athens airport expects 25 million arrivals this year , up from 21 million ; the incremental 4 million are not all eurozone and IMF officials intent on turning the country into a prot@@ ec@@ torate run from Brussels , Frankfurt and Washington ( home of the IMF ) . Maybe holidaymakers were hoping to be on the ground for euro break-up history . Or more likely Greece simply looks like a wonderful place to take the kids compared with resorts closer to territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State . But why aren &apos;t the Greeks man@@ ning the barricades in protest against already-@@ announced , painful VAT increases and pension cuts , and in anticipation of sw@@ ing@@ eing reductions in farm subsidies , controversial privati@@ sations and the opening of professions and industries to the harsh wind of competition ? Well it may be the calm before the revelation later this week of just how much Alexis Tsipras has conceded to obtain â &apos; ¬ 8@@ 6bn of new credit from the eurozone and ( well maybe ) the IMF , in the third bailout of this crip@@ pl@@ ingly indebted country . Surely at the very least Greek citizens will be curious to learn why Mr Tsipras is rushing to agree terms that he and his colleagues es@@ ch@@ ewed when elected at the turn of the year . Pre@@ sumably the explanation is that Greece &apos;s near-@@ death experience in July - the closure of banks and the collapse of economic activity - turned Syriza into dis@@ ci@@ ples of TI@@ NA ( &quot; there is no alternative &quot; ) . What is striking of course is that Tsipras remains remarkably popular , in spite of consp@@ icu@@ ously failing to deliver an end to fiscal ( tax and spending ) austerity . Wor@@ se , his standoff with the rest of the eurozone has sad@@ dled Greece with monetary austerity too : the continued partial closure of the banks mean they have no money to lend . Not that many Greek companies have the confidence to ask for a loan for investment , but if retailers and wholes@@ al@@ ers can &apos;t get adequate credit to obtain credit from abroad , Christmas will be cancelled ( 70 % of shops &apos; orders are placed in September and October , bankers tell me ) . There is the vice , in both senses of the word . Greece is suffering from a vicious economic squeeze , which will undoubtedly further impover@@ ish Greek people . So for all the relief throughout the eurozone that Syriza has finally been battered into submission , the new bailout will only hold if Tsipras can offer hope of better times ahead . Many would say that good economics and politics requires creditors to ease the burden of Greece &apos;s un@@ sustainably large debts by between a third and a half . So if this new bailout deal is to be that extraordinary thing , a path to genuine recovery , Brussels and - especially - Berlin will need to avoid tri@@ ump@@ hal@@ ism and manifest debt forgiveness in the face of Athens &apos; capit@@ ulation .

S-335	Many women have questioned the safety of the implants , which are used to treat in@@ continence , after suffering debilitating side effects . Two patients sitting on the original review group quit in protest at what they said was a water@@ ed-@@ down report . Now independent expert Alison Britton , a professor of healthcare and medical law , will examine the final report . Ms Robison told Holyrood &apos;s public petitions committee that Prof Britton , from Glasgow Caledonian University , would examine the process by which the report came to its conclusions . She told MSPs : &quot; Professor Britton will produce a report on how the independent review process was undertaken and importantly what lessons can be learned in the future . &quot; The report concluded procedures should not be offered routinely to women with pelvic organ pro@@ lapse . It recommended patients be offered a range of treatments and given the information to make &quot; informed choices . &quot; The report also said reporting of adverse events should be mandatory . Ms Robison confirmed the recommendations would continue to be implemented despite calls from campaigners for an all-out ban . The health secretary said the government did not have the power to ban the procedures as that lay with UK regulatory body the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency . In other evidence , the chairwoman of the independent review Tracey Gilli@@ es apologised for failing to unite all panel members around the review &apos;s controversial final report . Ms Gilli@@ es took over as chairwoman of the independent review of trans@@ vaginal mesh implants in its final stages towards the end of last year . It emerged she had no conversations with previous chairwoman Lesley Wilkie , who resigned for personal reasons . Her evidence was punctuated by cries of &quot; shame on you &quot; and &quot; rubbish &quot; from a packed public gallery which included some women who had suffered painful and debilitating complications as a result of the procedure . Ms Gilli@@ es said her task had been &quot; almost mission impossible from the beginning . &quot; She said : &quot; It was clear that there were strong@@ ly-@@ held views of difference at the point that I came in , so one could say more fool me for agreeing to chair this . &quot; This is not something that most people would have ... welcomed would be the wrong word , but it &apos;s clearly going to be a very difficult thing and I personally have reflected and feel disappointed that I have not achieved what I would have set out to do , which would have been to bring this in in consensus . Olive McIlroy and Elaine Holmes - who had both suffered complications as a result of the surgery - quit the review group earlier this year , saying they felt &quot; dismayed and disgusted &quot; at the publication of the independent report . It was claimed that parts of the final report had been removed . Following their resignations , it emerged that a consultant also quit the expert group over concerns about the final draft of the report . Over the past 20 years , more than 20,000 women in Scotland have had mesh or tape implants but some have suffered painful and debilitating complications . There are more than 400 women currently taking legal action against Scottish health boards and manufacturers as a result of mesh implant surgery .

S-310	Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al-@@ Mek@@ dad told the BBC &quot; Syria is doing its best &quot; to comply with the timetable to destroy its chemical weapons . Syria missed Wednesday &apos;s deadline to hand over its entire stockpile . Mr Mek@@ dad said a shipment of weapons came under attack twice on its way from Damascus to the port of Latakia . &quot; We shipped two shipments to the Syrian coast , &quot; he said . &quot; The second shipment was intercepted by fire from terrorist groups . &quot; He added : &quot; This is a serious business . Syria is in war , and the Americans and others have to take this into consideration . &quot; He described as &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; US Secretary of State John Kerry &apos;s recent condemnation of the government &apos;s use of barrel bombs in the city of Aleppo . The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims 246 people , including 73 children , have been killed in Aleppo in the last five days alone after barrels containing explosives and metal fragments were dropped by military helicopters . Acti@@ vist group The Aleppo Media Centre claims 14 people were killed in barrel bomb attacks on the Ma@@ sa@@ ken Han@@ ano district on Thursday , citing footage appearing to show bombs being dropped from a helicopter onto a civilian area . &quot; We are defending our people against terrorist attacks . We have never bombarded places with civilians , &quot; Mr Mek@@ dad insisted , accusing the US of &quot; still supporting terrorist elements &quot; in the country . The Syrian government , via state media , also denied reports that rebels had seized most of Aleppo &apos;s central prison . The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said members of the Islamic Front coalition , dominated by the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front , mounted the assault , freeing hundreds of detainees . But state television insisted soldiers and security forces had &quot; thwarted an attack against the prison by terrorist groups . &quot; The Observatory says fighting is still going on , but the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the Aleppo Media Centre , a citi@@ z@@ en-@@ journalist outlet , say rebels now completely control the prison . It is reported to hold at least 3,000 detainees , including Islamists , activists and minors , in horrific conditions . Syria has about 1,300 tonnes of declared chemical weapons . The US said last week that so far only about 4 % of the stockpile - 30 tonnes - had left the country . US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said he was &quot; concerned &quot; that the UN-backed plan was falling behind schedule and said Damascus &quot; had to take responsibility for fulfilling its commitment . &quot; Russia - a key ally of Syria - has said Damascus should complete the transfer of its chemical weapons to the coast for removal by ship by 1 March . A deadline was set last year for all the weapons to be destroyed by the end of June . The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) , which is overseeing the destruction operation , has admitted the process has been slowed down by security concerns . Mr Mek@@ dad stressed : &quot; Syria is committed to all its agreements , with the OPCW and the UN Security Council . We shall implement on time all our obligations . &quot;

S-469	HM Inspectorate of Probation found delays in getting offenders to start their work , and said too many were let off if they did not attend . In one case , an offender had completed just 16 hours in the 17 months since he had been sentenced . The Ministry of Justice said it was acting on the report &apos;s recommendations . Anything from 40 to 300 hours of unpaid work - or &quot; community payback &quot; - may be given for offences like shoplifting , theft , drug offences , or criminal damage . Some 70,000 offenders were ordered to do unpaid work such as garden maintenance , decor@@ ating or lit@@ ter-@@ picking in 2014 . Inspectors looked at 100 cases and interviewed 86 offenders from different probation divisions for their report . The report outlined 15 recommendations for improvement . Some of the problems identified were : Seven years ago the government , then led by Gordon Brown , placed an order for 10,000 orange bi@@ bs . They were to be worn by offenders doing unpaid work under a re-@@ branded scheme known as &quot; community payback . &quot; It was intended to give the public confidence that community sentences , involving clearing communal paths and gardens , picking up litter and painting over graffiti , were a &quot; tough &quot; alternative to imprisonment . When the coalition came to power in 2010 it promised to make unpaid work more physical and intense , with unemployed offenders required to complete their sentences more quickly . The difficulty has always been organisation . Getting people who lead chaotic lives - many of them with drink or drug problems - to work on time is a task in itself . If sanctions are applied , they will end up in prison ; if not , the sentence cannot be enforced . As the inspection report reveals , it is a problem the authorities still have not solved . Inspectors did praise instances of high-quality work , and cases where offenders believed they had gained skills from using good tools and equipment . They also highlighted that many offenders viewed their sentence positively and &quot; were determined to ... des@@ ist from future offending . &quot; Among its recommendations were that community rehabilitation companies should reduce how often offenders are turned away from work when they have reported on time , and to try to create objectives for unpaid work that &quot; match the circumstances of the offender . &quot; The chief inspector of probation , Paul Wilson , said it appeared in most cases that unpaid work was viewed simply as a punishment , which was a &quot; wasted opportunity . &quot; &quot; Although we found some high-quality management and delivery , much of it was simply not good enough , lacking in focus on the basic requirement to deliver and enforce the sentence of the court . &quot; He called for &quot; urgent remedial action . &quot; A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said it wanted &quot; much more effective rehabilitation &quot; - which had to start with making sure offenders turned up on time and faced consequences if they did not . &quot; It &apos;s totally unacceptable for offenders to skip work enforced by the courts . &quot; We accept all the recommendations for the Ministry of Justice in this report and are already taking action to implement them . &quot;

I am pulling for Del Potro and every player in the locker room is . No player deserves what he has had in the last three or four years . Former US Open champion Del Potro , 27 , reached the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2013 but the former world number four is playing in his first Grand Slam since the Australian Open in 2014 after having three wrist operations . He struggled early on as Wawrinka , 31 , claimed an early break before comfortably taking the opening set , but Del Potro fought back well to take the second . Both players broke serve twice in the opening four games of a thrilling third set , which Del Potro won in a tie-break , before taking the fourth set to wrap up victory . &quot; It feels amazing , &quot; Del Potro told BBC Sport . &quot; I beat one of the guys who is playing great tennis this season and I couldn &apos;t have expected this before today . &quot; I enjoyed the crowd , they were incredible and I &apos;m very happy . &quot; It is my second or third career now after all the injuries . I was sad for the last two years and now I am enjoying playing tennis again . I feel alive . &quot; Media playback is not supported on this device Australia &apos;s Nick Kyrgios is also in the same half of the draw as Murray and remains on course to meet the world number two in the last 16 . The number 15 seed came from two sets to one down to beat Germany &apos;s Dustin Brown 6-7 ( 3-7 ) 6-1 2-6 6-4 6-4 in a thrilling , rain-@@ affected second-round match on Court Two . The pair had only played three points before a rain delay of more than three hours with the German , ranked 8@@ 5th in the world , then clinching the first set on a tie-break . Kyrgios swept through the second set in just 15 minutes but Brown regained the advantage by taking the third . However , the Australian then won the fourth to move level and , after another rain delay , clinched the fifth set to reach round three . Spanish 22nd seed Fel@@ ici@@ ano Lopez will play Kyrgios in the third round , with the winner of that tie then playing either Murray or Australian John Mill@@ man in the last 16 . Lopez fought back from two sets behind to defeat Italian Fabio Fog@@ nini 3-6 6-7 6-3 6-3 6-3 . Elsewhere , there were routine victories for 10th seed Tomas Berdych and 12th seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga . Berdych beat Germany &apos;s Benjamin Becker 6-4 6-1 6-2 , while Tsonga triumphed 6-1 6-4 6-3 over Juan Monaco of Argentina .

S-139	The newly-@@ designed form , used to apply for a divorce in England and Wales , asks for the name &quot; of the person your spouse has committed adultery with . &quot; Family lawyers say that , in most cases , involving a third party adds &quot; conflict and complexity . &quot; The Ministry of Justice said there was &quot; no obligation &quot; to name people . Lawyer Margaret Heath@@ cote , vice-@@ chairwoman of family law group Resolution , is one of those concerned about the form . &quot; Generally speaking , we don &apos;t name the third party . It increases the conflict from day one , &quot; she said . &quot; There &apos;s no need . But because the box is there , the indication will be to fill it in . &quot; The online form has been updated to make the legal process more user-@@ friendly - especially as some complete the process without seeking legal advice . The guidance on the form highlights that it is &quot; not normally necessary &quot; to name the person your spouse committed adultery with . But Georgina Ham@@ bl@@ in , director at divorce lawyers , Var@@ d@@ ags , said people are &quot; unlikely to read the much smaller print or choose to ignore it . &quot; The older version of the form left a space for so-called &quot; co-@@ respondents &quot; to be named where appropriate . &quot; The new form flat@@ ly asks for &apos; the name of the person your spouse has committed adultery with &apos; , &quot; Ms Ham@@ bl@@ in explained . &quot; This is an invitation which I fear most broken hearts will not be able to refuse . &quot; If you name the person your husband or wife committed adultery with , they become part of the court case . They will be sent copies of the paperwork and given a chance to respond . If they don &apos;t respond , proceedings may be delayed and could incur more costs . According to the latest statistics , there were just over 100,000 divor@@ ces granted in England and Wales in 2015 . Ad@@ ul@@ tery was the reason for 12,@@ 148 of them . &quot; Un@@ reasonable behaviour &quot; accounted for 4@@ 6,@@ 8@@ 15 . Ms Ham@@ bl@@ in said 80 % of the new clients she deals with in matters of adultery &quot; want to get the new partner involved and to have their chance to say what they think of them . &quot; &quot; But it puts the peti@@ tioner in a bad light . We have to talk clients down from doing that , &quot; she said . &quot; Judges take a very dim view of peti@@ tioners trying to bring in new partners and embro@@ il them in proceedings . &quot; When you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following reasons : Source : Gov@@ .@@ UK A Ministry of Justice spokesman said : &quot; It has always been possible for a peti@@ tioner to name the person they believe their spouse has committed adultery with on divorce application forms . &quot; As set out in the previous form , and more clearly in the new form , there is obviously no obligation to do so . This is a relevant part of divorce proceedings . &quot;

S-384	The All Progres@@ sives Congress ( A@@ PC ) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday &apos;s elections . It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) since military ruled ended in 1999 . It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time . A@@ PC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May , after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan . The PDP &apos;s decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday &apos;s elections for governors and state assemblies , reports the BBC &apos;s Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital , Abuja . The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Kat@@ s@@ ina and Kad@@ una , the home of outgoing Vice-President Nam@@ adi Sam@@ bo . It also lost control of Adam@@ awa , one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram &apos;s insurgency . However , the party managed to hold on to Rivers State , Nigeria &apos;s oil hub . The PDP won eight govern@@ or@@ ships , mostly in the south-east . Tar@@ aba is the only result still outstanding , while the election in Im@@ o state was declared inconclusive , because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory . Elections were not held in seven states . Analysis : Chris Ew@@ ok@@ or , BBC Africa , Abuja The A@@ PC has made historic gains , releg@@ ating the once-@@ powerful PDP to a regional party . The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes , doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta . Most states in the north went to the A@@ PC , along with Nigeria &apos;s commercial hub , Lagos , in the south-west . However , the A@@ PC failed to win in any of Nigeria &apos;s five oil-@@ producing states . This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari , as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue . It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants . In parts of the country , the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry , and the battle for power and money . Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas , but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years , raising hopes that Nigeria &apos;s democracy is maturing . Why Jonathan lost ? Buhari &apos;s historic victory Nigeria &apos;s 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential . Some , especially in oil-@@ producing areas , control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries . The Independent National Electoral Commission ( Ine@@ c ) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll . Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states , where voting at some polling stations had to be extended . On Sunday , Ine@@ c also announced that the A@@ PC had retained power in Lagos state . It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999 . Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of intr@@ osp@@ ection , and then rebuild itself under a new leader . The party was in power for 16 years , and voters felt that it was time for change , he says . It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the A@@ PC ahead of the elections . The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule , and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islam@@ ist@@ -led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats .

S-91	Media playback is not supported on this device Victory in Toulouse on Monday would secure Wales &apos; spot in the knockout phase , in their first major international tournament since 1958 . &quot; This team has got the potential to go on and on . They &apos;ve got everything to look forward to , &quot; said Coleman . &quot; We are in a fantastic position . Nevertheless , there &apos;s more to come . &quot; Wales , who beat Slovakia 2-1 in their opening game before losing 2-1 to England , could still qualify for the last 16 with a draw against Russia . Coleman added : &quot; Whilst everybody will look at this game as the be all and end all , whether we progress or not it &apos;s not the end of the journey for this team . &quot; Our players have done unbelievably well . It &apos;s been an eye-@@ opener and hard , of course . It &apos;s really intense but it &apos;s been enjoyable . &quot; Coleman said that , however far Wales progress in France , the players will &quot; learn from this tournament . &quot; He said : &quot; This group , this team , they can &apos;t lose because whenever we go home , whenever that time is , we have gained so much experience . &quot; Normally we get to a certain level and in June we are playing a friendly game - we are playing the Netherlands , who are already qualified and who are planning for a tournament . &quot; Now we are at a tournament ourselves and this group gets all the praise and accolades they deserve . And it is not over for us . &quot; Joe Allen has welcomed Wales &apos; Euro 2016 day of destiny by saying the squad are determined to have no regrets over the tournament . &quot; You don &apos;t want it to be the be all and end all in the sense that you take your foot off the pedal at any time in the future , &quot; said Allen . &quot; You want to make sure that this is something that we get to experience again , but playing at this stage as a footballer is the highest level - and we certainly want to make sure that there are no regrets on our part . &quot; I think coming off the pitch no matter what happens , we &apos;re confident we &apos;ll do the business . &quot; We want to make sure that we throw absolutely everything at it . &quot; We &apos;re confident that we can get ourselves into the knock-out rounds and , after that , who knows what could happen ? &quot; Allen says Wales will shut out what is happening in the England game with Slovakia as qualification is in their own hands . The two matches will be played simultaneously as Group B draws to a conclusion . And the Liverpool midfielder promises a positive approach against Russian opponents who need to win to keep their own last 16 hopes alive . &quot; It &apos;s a difficult one , &quot; he said . &quot; It &apos;s one where people think if you set up just to cling on to that point it can often be the downfall of teams . &quot; That won &apos;t be our approach , but it is one where we want to make sure we are more in control of how we go about our performance . &quot; Per@@ forming well is first and foremost what we want to do , because we know when the focus is on doing that then the results come with it . &quot; Wales assistant boss O@@ sian Roberts confirmed Wales have a fully-@@ fit squad to choose from for the Russia game .

Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple &apos;s marketing chief Phil Sch@@ iller . I turned around and headed back to the Mos@@ cone Centre . Having located Mr Sch@@ iller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone . He gr@@ ac@@ iously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring J@@ ony I@@ ve or order 5,000 l@@ att@@ es as Steve Jobs had on stage , I brandis@@ hed it at the camera for my Ten O &apos;@@ Clock News piece . The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clut@@ ched the phone as if it were &quot; a fragment of the true cross , &quot; and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch . I appeared on the New@@ sw@@ atch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I m@@ used on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we &apos;d had a TV news bulletin back then . Afterwards , I rather regretted saying that - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership ? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish . The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade , putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries . One example is in the photograph at the top of this article . It &apos;s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SL@@ R camera . In difficult lighting conditions , I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage . Com@@ pare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pix@@ el , and was the work of the same incompetent photographer . This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SL@@ R for days . My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move . Of course , there were cameras on phones before 2007 , just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email . But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn &apos;t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text . So , despite my rather British dist@@ aste for the hyper@@ b@@ ole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history . Other firms , notably Amazon and Google , are now taking us forward with innovative products im@@ bu@@ ed with artificial intelligence . But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began .

S-26	The party &apos;s economy spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth warned steel &apos;s troubles were a &quot; can@@ ary in the mine , &quot; warning of deeper problems across a range of industries . These include basic metals , chemicals and wood . The Welsh government called on Westminster to address the impact of high energy prices on industry . The UK government has been asked to comment . Plaid said Gross Value Added ( GVA ) figures - which measure the value of goods and services produced - show the so-called foundation industries in Wales have suffered a 39 % decline in the five years to 2013 . Mr ap Iorwerth urged the Welsh government to take action to help industries combat high energy costs . He said : &quot; Figures show that the threat to our economy runs far deeper than steel , but affects the range of industries that our economy is built upon . &quot; This includes the chemical industry , other metals , and wood products . Wales &apos; foundation industries have witnessed a steep decline . &quot; He said UK government should also work with the EU to ensure maximum flexibility in use of procurement legislation so that they can better protect British industry . A Welsh government spokesman said : &quot; No-one has defended the steel industry more than the Welsh government . &quot; We have raised with the UK government over several years our concerns about the impact high UK energy prices are having on the competitiveness of our industries and again call on them to address this major problem . &quot; The economy minister has set-up an industry-@@ led task group to gather examples of good procurement practices and to identify support other EU countries have provided to their steel industries . &quot; Pro Steel Engineering in Cal@@ dic@@ ot , Monmouthshire , is only three years old but has benefited from contracts in London , including the new Olympic Stadium roof in London for West Ham United and strengthening the Hammersmith fly-@@ over . Director Richard Selby said : &quot; We &apos;re fortunate we &apos;re expanding and are hoping to start recruiting in a couple of months and we have a full order book . &quot; We &apos;ve had the ability to stay agile and seizing the opportunities . &quot; But the foundation industries need a lot more support , particularly with the energy costs we have , and we need for the Welsh government and Westminster to get behind them to help them thrive . &quot; Economist Prof Calvin Jones , of Cardiff University , said the foundation industries were still important in terms of their high economic value and for being iconic . But he said Wales &apos; growth areas had been in retail , hotels , back-@@ office financial services and the public sector . &quot; We have to think about how they will fulfil Wales &apos; economic destiny as we &apos;d like to see it , &quot; he said . &quot; Of course , on current structures they can &apos;t , they simply aren &apos;t like Tata which is a company which is incredibly valuable in so many ways . &quot; A back office for a bank simply can &apos;t do the same things for Wales , no matter how many b@@ ums on seats there are in those call centres . They don &apos;t provide the same jobs or a narrative for the Welsh economy that will give us a future vision . &quot; Prof Jones said the steel industry in Wales had done relatively well to avoid the worst of the crisis so far . &quot; There have been big rounds of redundancies over the last 30 years and we &apos;ve a very lean operation in Wales and geographically we &apos;re better placed than those steelworks in the north of England and Scotland . &quot;

S-480	In the late 1960s / early 1970s , the ice fields slipping down Mont Blanc and the surrounding mountains of the European range covered some 3@@ 75 sq km . By the late 2000s , this area had fallen to about 275 sq km . The research has been presented at the American Ge@@ ophysical Union ( AG@@ U ) Fall Meeting , the world &apos;s largest annual gathering of Earth scientists . It mirrors some findings of retreat occurring in other sectors of the Alps which sit across the borders of several nations , but predominantly Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , Germany , France , and Italy . The new French Alps glaciers inventory was produced by Marie Gar@@ dent , from the University of Savo@@ ie , and colleagues . It assessed the roughly 600 glaciers in broad areas incorporating the E@@ cr@@ ins , Bel@@ le@@ don@@ ne , Van@@ oise , U@@ b@@ aye and Grande Rous@@ se Ar@@ ves mas@@ si@@ fs , as well as the famous Mont Blanc Mas@@ si@@ f in the north . The team drew upon map archives , past satellite imagery and aerial photographs . Man@@ ual inspection was used to check the automatic del@@ in@@ ea@@ tion methods employed in the pictures was correct . &quot; We use manual del@@ in@@ ea@@ tion to verify the satellite data because there can be a problem with debris cover on a glacier , &quot; explained Ms Gar@@ dent . &quot; Autom@@ atic del@@ in@@ ea@@ tion from satellite data will sometimes say there is no glacier when in fact we know there is one there . Also , deep shadows can hide the glacier margins . &quot; The only existing glacial inventory from the French Alps was published four decades ago within the context of the World Gl@@ ac@@ ier Inv@@ ent@@ ory . It found the overall area of ice to be about 3@@ 75 sq km . By 198@@ 5-@@ 86 , in spite of a short advancing period in the late 70s / early 80s , glacial coverage had decreased to a value close to 340 sq km , the new survey shows . Since then , the withdrawal has accelerated , with the area being reduced to about 275 sq km in the late 2000s . This represents an average loss of some 26 % over the last 40 years . The retreat is not uniform across the French Alps , however . The greatest losses have been seen in the southern sectors . In the Bel@@ le@@ don@@ ne Mas@@ si@@ f , for example , glaciers have almost completely disappeared ; and in the E@@ cr@@ ins Mas@@ si@@ f , glacial retreat is more than three times stronger than in the Mont Blanc Mas@@ si@@ f . &quot; The glacier retreat is less important in the northern Alps than in the southern Alps , &quot; Ms Gar@@ dent emphasised . &quot; We think this is because of the lower elevation of the mountains in the south , but also because of clim@@ atic conditions which are different . There is more precip@@ itation in the north and there is also more cloud . &quot; The northern region includes the biggest French glacier of all - La M@@ er de Gl@@ ace , which falls over a 1@@ ,000m in altitude down Mont Blanc itself . Its area today is just over 30 sq km , a shade smaller than the 3@@ 1.5 sq km in the late 1960s / early 1970s . Efforts to assess and monitor glacier health are going on across the Alpine region . At this very meeting three years ago , Swiss researchers reported that glaciers on their part of the European range were also losing mass at an accelerating rate . Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET @ bbc.co.uk

S-232	They range from extra responsibility for off-@@ street parking , through to tourism . Pot@@ entially , though , the most controversial move will be putting politicians in charge of all but the most significant planning decisions . Councils will be able to accept or reject developments in their own areas . Currently , if you want to build a new house or erect an extension , you have to apply for permission to the Planning Service , an agency that comes under the umbrella of Stormont &apos;s environment department . Planning officials refer your application to your local council . The councillors can express their opinion on the merits of your application , but the final say rests with the Planning Service . From April 2015 that responsibility will shift to the councils themselves , meaning elected politicians will make planning decisions . So is this a positive move , democrati@@ sing our planning system ? Michael Corr , the creative director of Northern Ireland &apos;s architecture and planning centre , PL@@ AC@@ E , is optimistic . Mr Corr already works with councils and government departments , providing advice on new developments like leisure centres . He told me the move is &quot; a huge opportunity for the future , which offers local councils an opportunity to develop their own community and development plans . &quot; But do Northern Ireland &apos;s politicians have the necessary skills ? Speaking about voters , Mr Corr said : &quot; They really want to choose politicians who have the ability and understand urban regeneration and planning issues , because it &apos;s those politicians who will be able to make the biggest difference . &quot; However , not everyone is so upbeat . Back in the 1960s , local councils in Northern Ireland were accused of discrimination in the allocation of public housing . Protests , like the one against Dungannon council &apos;s allocation of housing in County Tyrone , fuelled the Civil Rights movement . The environmental group Friends of the Earth warn that a strict code of conduct will have to be rigorously enforced in order to ensure the new councils &apos; handling of planning matters is regarded as fair and transparent . James Orr , Northern Ireland director for Friends of the Earth , said : &quot; In terms of property deals and in terms of politic@@ king , we could see a situation not too far away from what happened in the 1960s , where certain communities get planning permission more favourably than other communities . &quot; Mr Orr is also concerned about what he describes as a &quot; tradition of close relationships between developers and political parties here . &quot; He said : &quot; It &apos;s quite easy to see that continuing , where we get a la@@ is@@ se@@ z-@@ fa@@ ire system which says , &apos; you look after your community and we won &apos;t bother engaging in proper democratic planning &apos; . That is a real danger and that &apos;s why we need the nuts and bolts of good transparency put in place . &quot; Friends of the Earth argue that giving politicians more powers with real financial consequences for developers and obj@@ ectors makes it increasingly important that the public should know who don@@ ates to Northern Ireland &apos;s political parties . Some local politicians remain opposed to the move , because they say it could deter donors worried about their personal security . Others argue that the Â £ 7,500 limit for declaring donations is largely irrelevant to Northern Ireland , as the Stormont parties don &apos;t attract such large amounts . Under the terms of a law passed earlier this year , it &apos;s up to the Northern Ireland Secretary to decide when the time is right to make an order shedding more light on political donations .

S-5	Bi@@ ologists studied a group of Sydney octop@@ uses off Australia &apos;s east coast and observed a range of behaviour that may indicate complex social signalling . Oc@@ top@@ uses that stand tall , turn dark and spread their web in a &quot; Nos@@ fer@@ atu pose &quot; are likely showing aggression . Con@@ versely , octop@@ uses may display a pale colour after losing a fight or when trying to avoid conflict . It was previously believed that octop@@ uses were largely solitary creatures . Changes to body colour and other behaviour were interpreted as tactics to avoid predators . But Prof Peter God@@ fre@@ y-@@ Smith said the unique study , based on 53 hours of footage and published on Friday in the journal Current Biology , provided a novel perspective on octop@@ us behaviour . &quot; &#91; An aggressive &#93; octop@@ us will turn very dark , stand in a way that acc@@ ent@@ u@@ ates its size and it will often seek to stand on a higher spot , &quot; Prof God@@ fre@@ y-@@ Smith , who co-@@ authored the report , said . &quot; Clearly the unusual stance is not a physi@@ ological response . It makes it look as big as it can possibly be , with its arms spread out below and the mantle , the back part of the animal , raised over the head . &quot; The dark colour is produced in concert with those siz@@ e-@@ acc@@ ent@@ u@@ ating behaviours . There &apos;s no particular physi@@ ological reason why darkness should be associated with aggression , but it does give the impression of a larger object . &quot; The researchers , based in Australia and the US , dubbed the stance the &quot; Nos@@ fer@@ atu pose , &quot; referring to the classic 1920s horror film , because the spread of the octop@@ us &apos;s web was reminiscent of a v@@ ampire &apos;s cap@@ e . Oc@@ top@@ uses frequently turned pale while retreating from aggres@@ sors and also produced high-@@ contrast patterns known as de@@ im@@ atic displays . The contrasting patterns were most frequently observed when octop@@ uses were attempting to return to their den after they had been forced out , or in the presence of an aggressive individual . &quot; Sup@@ pose there &apos;s a large , aggressive guy there and you want to get back into our den , if you approach with a pale colour it could be interpreted as a non-@@ confrontational behaviour , &quot; Prof God@@ fre@@ y-@@ Smith said . The study also found that two octop@@ uses displaying dark colours were likely to fight if in close proximity , while a dark@@ er-@@ coloured octop@@ us was likely to stand its ground against a ligh@@ ter-@@ coloured octop@@ us . Another cep@@ ha@@ lo@@ pod , the cut@@ t@@ lef@@ ish , shows a similar set of features , with aggressive males dark@@ ening their faces and pal@@ er males withdrawing from fights . The unusually high number of octop@@ uses living together in the colony off Jervis Bay , south of Sydney , allowed a more in-depth observation of interactions than had previously been possible . Prof God@@ fre@@ y-@@ Smith &apos;s co-author David Sch@@ eel and his students com@@ bed through 53 hours of footage and observed 186 interactions between the octop@@ uses . This included the Nos@@ fer@@ atu pose , along with reaching , grappling and mating . Watching these long videos was &quot; much more exhausting than I expected , &quot; Prof Godfrey Smith said . &quot; Identi@@ fying an individual from minute to minute is very difficult , because they change colour and shape . &quot; If the octop@@ us w@@ anders out of the frame , there &apos;s not much you can do . &quot;

S-240	Presiding officer Tricia Mar@@ wick shed tears after veteran Labour MSP Duncan McNeil bid farewell to the parliament . And she was again visibly emotional after Mr Salmond told the chamber : &quot; It &apos;s goodbye from me ... for now . &quot; Ms Mar@@ wick , Mr Salmond and Mr McNeil are among those standing down as MSPs ahead of the election on 5 May . Mr Salmond , who served as first minister between 2007 and 2014 , used his val@@ ed@@ ic@@ tory address to repeat a belief he expressed in his very first speech in the parliament that Scotland was &quot; not divided , but diverse . &quot; He said both the country and parliament were on a journey , and added : &quot; Yes we are a country of different views , but we are not divided . There is in fact a broad consensus on the need for this parliament to assume greater responsibility for the governance of Scotland . &quot; And we are definitely stronger - so much stronger - as a result of that . &quot; He welcomed the transfer of powers to Holyrood under the Scotland Bill , but again insisted the bill did not fulfil the pledges which he said had been made by unionist politicians in the last days of the referendum campaign . There were li@@ ghters moments as Mr Salmond , who was speaking before the Chancellor delivered his UK budget , joked that he was aware that he faced competition from a &quot; major attraction down south today . &quot; He then added : &quot; However , on balance , I feel that the champion chase at Cheltenham racecourse will not be overshadowed by my remarks . &quot; And the former SNP leader joked that he wished everyone standing in the forthcoming election good luck , &quot; albeit with varying degrees of enthusiasm . &quot; He concluded his address by saying : &quot; Let me leave you with these final thoughts - there is no greater honour in public life than to be a member of this parliament . &quot; There is no greater task than to mould the public purpose of Scotland . There is no greater cause than to serve the people of this country . &quot; And so with that it is goodbye from me ... for now . &quot; Ms Mar@@ wick thanked Mr Salmond for his contribution both as an MSP and as first minister , and added that he had &quot; served the parliament and Scotland with distinction . &quot; The presiding officer had earlier been moved to tears by a powerful final speech by Scottish Labour backbencher Duncan McNeil , who is stepping down as an MSP after serving in the parliament since it was established in 1999 . Mr McNeil used his address to warn that Holyrood had things to learn from Westminster , particularly with regard to the committee system . He said : &quot; It will be this parliament &apos;s responsibility to ensure there is accountability , there is scrutiny and even opposition when that is necessary . &quot; We must ensure we are capable of meeting that challenge , or we will face the consequences . &quot; He recalled how former Labour MP Robin Cook came to Holyrood to look at the lessons that could be learned when it came to reforming Westminster . But Mr McNeil said : &quot; It sad@@ dens me to say we now have to do a bit of learning from them and how they run their business . &quot; Former Scottish Conservative MSP Annabel Goldie is also bowing out of Holyrood . In her speech , she joked she would miss her dealings with Finance Secretary John Swinney , especially &quot; his huge out@@ bursts of f@@ aux indig@@ nation . &quot;

S-320	Hibs have started the process of appointing a new boss after thanking Stubbs for doing &quot; a magnificent job &quot; over his two-year spell . Stubbs , 44 , decided to return to England shortly after ending Hibs &apos; 11@@ 4-@@ year wait to win the Scottish Cup . &quot; They fitted in with my ambition , &quot; Stubbs said of Rotherham . The Englishman has signed a three-year deal with the Millers , who reached a settlement with Hibs over compensation for Stubbs and his assistant , John Doolan . &quot; Alan and his staff have done a magnificent job , with the pinnacle obviously being that historic Scottish Cup win for which every Hibernian supporter is thankful , &quot; said Hibs chief executive Lee@@ ann Demp@@ ster . &quot; We wish them every success in the future &quot; The task now for Hibernian is to find a head coach who will lead us back into Scotland &apos;s top flight by winning the Championship this season . &quot; We expect high calibre candidates , and while we understand there will be a lot of speculation , as ever this club will go about its business quietly and professionally and speak when there is something meaningful to say . &quot; Speaking for the first time since his appointment at New York Stadium , Stubbs admitted it was a &quot; really difficult decision &quot; to leave Hibs , but that moving to the Championship in England was &quot; the next chapter &quot; for his career . Rotherham finished one place outside the relegation zone last season but Stubbs believes he can guide the team up the table to match his own ambitions and those of chairman Tony Stewart . &quot; I was impressed by what the chairman had to say , what his vision is for the club and the ambition , &quot; he explained . &quot; The club &apos;s had two seasons where they &apos;ve stabilised in the Championship and we &apos;re looking to take the club forward . We want to be moving up the table and ultimately we want to be a club that is around the play-offs . That has to be the aim . Media playback is not supported on this device &quot; The plan has always been to be the best I can . I wanted to manage at the very top level . I got a great opportunity at Hibernian , they &apos;ve been fantastic with me , I really enjoyed my two years there . &quot; I &apos;m glad I &apos;ve been able to leave on the back of a successful end to the season but now it &apos;s a new chapter and one that &apos;s very exciting for me . &quot; Stewart insisted that , despite lengthy talks with Hibs over compensation - and Stubbs and Doolan ultimately resigning from their posts - relations between the two clubs were fine . And he confirmed that compensation will be paid to the Easter Road club . &quot; Alan had another year on his contract , so we did the protocol with Hibs , &quot; Stewart said . &quot; My CEO had discussions with them to talk to Alan and that led to the appointment . We agreed a settlement with Hibs and we move forward now freely . &quot; We &apos;ve followed Alan &apos;s career . He was on the radar months ago , the timing was right and we took the opportunity . I like the drive , the leadership . &quot; Football is about moving around . Hibs have been fantastic , Alan &apos;s told me how good they &apos;ve been up there and it &apos;s sad they &apos;ve lost a manager and Rotherham gained him . We look forward now to getting ready for next season . &quot;

S-316	Four days after the launch of the anti-corruption move , long queues continue outside ATMs as people try to exchange the 500 ( $ 7 ) and 1,000 notes . &quot; It had to be done suddenly but I never thought I will receive bl@@ ess@@ ings for this , &quot; Mr Modi said . He hinted that other measures aimed at fighting corruption and the black economy might follow . Ur@@ ging people to be patient , Finance Minister Arun Ja@@ it@@ ley said that it would take a few weeks for banks and ATMs to completely replace the old notes , estimated to make up some 85 % of the total currency in circulation . Mr Ja@@ it@@ ley said that nearly $ 30bn in the old notes had so far been deposited in banks across the country . But chaotic scenes can still be witnessed outside banks as public patience is beginning to wear out , says the BBC &apos;s San@@ joy Ma@@ jum@@ der in Delhi . Some traders and small business owners have threatened to go on strike because they have been badly affected , our correspondent says . The opposition has also been critical of the move , saying the rural and urban poor have been hit hardest . But Mr Modi thanked his fellow countr@@ ymen who had &quot; accepted the decision in national interest . &quot; And he warned that there was &quot; no guarantee &quot; that new measures would not follow after the not@@ e-@@ exchange scheme ends on 30 December . He said &quot; no-one would be spared &quot; in the drive against corruption . But &quot; honest people will not face any problem , &quot; he added . After Mr Modi &apos;s surprise announcement on Tuesday night , the banks were closed on Wednesday . Thousands of panicked Indians have been f@@ locking to banks since they reopened on Thursday . There are limits on cash withdrawals from ATMs and banks . The 500 ( $ 7 ; Â £ 6 ) and 1,000 ( $ 15 ; Â £ 12 ) rupee notes are the highest denomination notes in the country and are extremely common in India . Airports , railway stations , hospitals and fuel stations will only accept them until the end of today . People will be able to exchange their money at banks between 10 November and 30 December . The actual figure is unclear but correspondents say the issue of &quot; black money &quot; - which may have been acquired cor@@ ruptly , or is being withheld from the tax authorities - is a huge problem . India &apos;s government hopes to flush out tax ev@@ aders and make money that is unaccounted for visible for tax purposes . There have been reports of tax raids in many parts of India . An individual can put as much as he or she likes into the bank - but withdrawals are limited so the banking system may end up being flooded with cash . Government guidelines say it is possible to exchange up to 4,000 rupees per day up to 24 November - anything over this will be subject to tax laws . People can also withdraw up to 10,000 rupees from a bank per day and a maximum of 20,000 rupees per week . New 2,000 and 500 rupee denomination notes with new security features are being given to people to replace those removed from circulation . A new 1,000 rupee note &quot; with a new dimension and design &quot; will also be introduced in due course , a senior government official said on Thursday . They can purchase foreign exchange equivalent to 5,000 rupees using these bank notes at airport exchange counters until midnight on Friday .

S-387	That report was never written , but the murdered opposition politician &apos;s colleagues , led by his close associate Ily@@ a Y@@ ash@@ in , have since worked to finish it . Most of the Russian-@@ language report , entitled Putin . War , is based on facts that have already appeared in Russian and foreign media since Crimea was annexed in March 2014 and conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine . But its authors say putting the facts together and describing the human and economic cost of the conflict makes a very compelling case for accusing President Vladimir Putin of waging war in Ukraine for his own ends . Russia has consistently denied accusations that it has sent regular troops and armour to help rebels in eastern Ukraine , arguing that any Russians serving there are &quot; volunteers . &quot; But Mr Y@@ ash@@ in , who presented the report , said Russian soldiers and equipment were decisive to securing all major victories claimed by the pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk . &quot; All the separatists &apos; key successes were secured by Russian army units , &quot; he said . &quot; The soldiers directly admit they were directed on to Ukraine territory , admit that they were brought there to take part in a war operation . There is no doubt they did not end up there by accident . &quot; The dossier presents evidence of volunteer soldiers who admit that it was Russian generals , not separatists , who directed the main battles in eastern Ukraine . A Russian army veteran , described as helping to en@@ list volunteers , says they are not doing it for nothing : salaries can reach $ 2@@ ,000-@@ 3,000 ( Â £ 1,@@ 25@@ 0-@@ 1,900 ) a month . Russian spending on the conflict is calculated at 5@@ 3bn roubles ( Â £ 66@@ 5m ; $ 1bn ) : Boris Nemtsov began work on the report early this year , after hearing that the relatives of dead Russian soldiers had not been given promised compensation . But those relatives never went public and , after his assassination , have become even more scared . N@@ ames and numbers of military units are documented , along with photos of weaponry , although activists point out these are harder to verify without knowing where they were taken . How many Russians are fighting in Ukraine ? BBC team attacked while investigating soldiers &apos; deaths Russian families look for soldier sons Mr Y@@ ash@@ in said the opposition would seek donations to extend the initial print run of only 2,000 copies . But publishing and distributing this kind of dossier is hard work . Many publishers were afraid to work with this material , he said . And above all , the question remains : How many people are keen to learn the facts which for months have been available on the internet and the few liberal media that remain in Russia ? There are plenty of Russians aware of their country &apos;s involvement in eastern Ukraine , who nevertheless find it acceptable , because they believe Moscow is supporting those who wish to be independent of the government in Kiev . But the opposition does not see it as support . It accuses President Putin of masterminding and directing the war to boost his failing popularity . In this , they admit he was successful . And it is entirely possible their report may well see the same fate as earlier works published by the late Boris Nemtsov . Critics of Mr Putin praised Mr Nemtsov &apos;s reports on corruption in the president &apos;s entourage and on the true cost of the 2014 Sochi Olympics . But they failed to galvanise protests against him .

S-499	Inf@@ ecti@@ ously-@@ catchy ear@@ worm &apos; PP@@ AP &apos; ( short for Pen@@ -@@ P@@ ine@@ appl@@ e-@@ Appl@@ e-@@ Pen &apos; ) was performed by animal prin@@ t-@@ clad DJ Pik@@ o-@@ Tar@@ o , a fictional character played by Japanese entertainer Kaz@@ u@@ hi@@ ko Kos@@ aka . And it goes like this : &quot; I have a pen . I have an apple . Appl@@ e-@@ pen ! I have a pen . I have &#91; a &#93; p@@ ine@@ apple . P@@ ine@@ appl@@ e-@@ pen ! Appl@@ e-@@ pen . P@@ ine@@ appl@@ e-@@ pen . Pen@@ -@@ P@@ ine@@ appl@@ e-@@ Appl@@ e-@@ Pen . &quot; But how did the 40-year-old DJ come up with such a bizarre song about f@@ using a pen with an apple and a p@@ ine@@ apple ? &quot; When I was making this music with play , I was &#91; just &#93; singing it too soon , &quot; the newly-@@ crowned internet star explained in a tweet to fans from an account created for his newly-@@ coined character . It has all the ingredients for a viral video formula : an addictive beat , silly lyrics and a hilar@@ iously simple dance routine to back it up . And it was only a matter of time before the min@@ ut@@ e-long song , first uploaded onto Pik@@ o-@@ Tar@@ o &apos;s official YouTube channel , quickly spread to Facebook . While the original video has gone on to am@@ ass more than 4m views , entertainment portal 9@@ G@@ AG &apos;s Facebook video surpassed that to draw more than 44m views . &quot; I &apos;m ruined - I will never get this song out of my head , &quot; lamented Facebook user Carlos Andr@@ Ã © s Silva in a comment . Nelson Rivera Adrian Paige agreed , voicing concern for the number of times he has looped the video . &quot; I am both highly amused as well as extremely confused . &quot; Other users like Daniel H@@ ou who watched the video pointed out Pik@@ o-@@ Tar@@ o &apos;s unique wardrobe . &quot; Am I the only one who noticed that this guy is the real-life version of Bor@@ sal@@ ino &#91; K@@ iz@@ aru &#93; from One Pi@@ ece , &quot; he said , drawing reference to the popular flamboy@@ ant@@ ly-@@ dressed man@@ ga-@@ ani@@ me character . But one man &apos;s catchy viral song may prove to be another &apos;s j@@ arring burden . &quot; Please stop sharing this annoying song , it &apos;s exploded on my feed and is driving me up the wall because it &apos;s so irrit@@ ating to listen to , &quot; said Facebook user H@@ iro Ken@@ sh@@ ida in a plea . At time of writing , few mainstream Japanese news sites have covered this particular ear@@ worm , even though it has been widely picked up internationally . It has not particularly tren@@ ded on Japanese social media . He has already been dubbed the next P@@ sy and it could even be that this was precisely what was in mind - one catchy dit@@ ty , pushed by digital influ@@ encers but with the precise aim of becoming a global phenomenon . But the hype did not stop there . Hundreds of tributes and covers of Pik@@ o-@@ Tar@@ o &apos;s tune have also appeared on Facebook , each gaining cult follow@@ ings of their own . Many Japanese stars , including popular duo Rik@@ o and R@@ ika , came up with v@@ ines of their own . There &apos;s even been a heavy metal tribute as well as a cover from Thai social media star Happy Pol@@ la . What a time to be alive .

S-69	Media playback is not supported on this device The Briton , 30 , won 6-2 4-6 6-1 7-5 after two hours and 39 minutes , with match point clinched at 20 : 57 BST . Fog@@ nini , the 29th seed , had five set points to force a fifth set but Murray won five games in a row to seal a place in the last 16 for the 11th time . Murray will play Frenchman Benoit Pa@@ ire in the fourth round on Monday . Fellow Briton Johanna Konta earlier reached the second week for the first time with a 6-4 6-1 win over Maria Sak@@ k@@ ari of Greece . Media playback is not supported on this device &quot; The end of the match was tense . It was an up and down match . I didn &apos;t feel like it was the best tennis at times but I managed to get through , &quot; Murray told the BBC . &quot; It was getting dark towards the end and I was probably thinking a bit about that . &quot; We would have had to go off for the roof to go on , so that would have meant a change in conditions . I &apos;m pleased to get off in four . &quot; Media playback is not supported on this device Murray looked like avoiding a long , draw@@ n-out contest when he moved ahead early in the third set but a Friday night drama would develop as the light faded . Fog@@ nini , 30 , showed both his talented and temper@@ am@@ ental sides as he got within sight of a fifth set , which would have required the roof to be brought across or both men to return on Saturday . The Italian , who recently beat Murray on clay in Rome , looked well off the pace when he double-@@ fa@@ ulted twice in a row to lose the first set , but he began to assert himself in the second . Fog@@ nini broke for a second time to lead 3-2 and went on to level at one set all , before firing his 13th baseline winner to just one for Murray by the start of the third set . At 30-@@ 30 , Murray was on the defensive and looking increasingly vulnerable , but he clung on with a second serve and the scream of relief jol@@ ted him and the Centre Court crowd to life . Across the net , Fog@@ nini &apos;s challenge was apparently fading , an ankle injury not helping as the errors flowed and the set slipped away . A gripping fourth set unfolded , with passions rising on and off court as Fog@@ nini was penalised a point for a visible obscen@@ ity following a gesture , and Murray complaining to the umpire that the Italian was taking too long between points . It was Fog@@ nini who took control after Murray double-@@ fa@@ ulted in game six , but from 5-2 down Murray showed all his fighting qualities to save set points in three consecutive games . The 15,000 spectators on Centre Court were on their feet as the Briton levelled at 5-5 , and Fog@@ nini could not halt Murray &apos;s momentum as the champion served his way to victory . &quot; I feel OK , &quot; added Murray . &quot; I didn &apos;t feel I moved as well as the first couple of matches but I &apos;ve got a couple of days break now and can work on that and hopefully get myself in a good rhythm and play some good tennis on Monday . &quot; I &apos;m happy to get through the first week and anything can happen from here on . &quot;

S-256	The product will offer teachers new ways to use the world-@@ building video game in a range of subjects . Microsoft paid $ 2.5bn ( Â £ 1.8bn ) for Mo@@ j@@ ang , Minecraft &apos;s Swedish creator , in 2014 . And late last year , it bought the four-year-old Min@@ ec@@ raf@@ t@@ Ed@@ u version of the game from Fin@@ land-based independent developer Te@@ ach@@ er@@ G@@ aming . It is now promising to add features , but schools may face extra costs . It says more than 7,000 classrooms around the world already use Minecraft in some form . &quot; Teachers are using Minecraft to do so many things , including teaching maths , science , religion and poetry , &quot; Anthony Sal@@ ci@@ to , Microsoft &apos;s vice-president of worldwide education , told the BBC . &quot; Once we make the tools easier for schools to get access to and employ , I think you &apos;ll see that number &#91; of classrooms &#93; grow quite quickly . &quot; Min@@ ec@@ raf@@ t@@ Ed@@ u already allows teachers to modify content in the game and use a shared library of educ@@ ation-@@ themed assets . Microsoft is promising to improve the experience by : To access the service , children and teachers each need their own Office 365 ID , which can also be used to provide access to the Microsoft &apos;s clou@@ d-based productivity software . Microsoft says this will help teachers minimise the number of online accounts they need to manage . But it may also help the company promote its word processing , email , and fil@@ e-@@ sharing apps over rival services from Google and others . Microsoft intends to charge an annual fee of $ 5 ( Â £ 3.@@ 50 ) for each teacher and child . That could prove more expensive than the current basic set-up , where schools pay a one-off fee of $ 14 multipl@@ ied by the maximum number of people they want to be able to log in at once , plus an additional $ 41 for server software . &quot; We believe we are bringing added value , &quot; said Deirdre Quar@@ n@@ strom , director of Minecraft education . &quot; On top of having a persistent identity , they will also have access to the most current version of the game . &quot; Min@@ ec@@ raf@@ t@@ Ed@@ u , along with other Minecraft mo@@ ds , was one to two releases behind by nature of the development process . &quot; We are also replacing the need for schools to have and maintain separate server hardware . &quot; The new features were welcomed by Leigh Wol@@ mar@@ ans , the head teacher of L@@ ings Primary School in Northampton . His school already uses Min@@ ec@@ raf@@ t@@ Ed@@ u to teach pupils about A Mid@@ summer Night &apos;s Dream by asking them to create a performance of Shakespeare &apos;s play within the game . However , he said other teachers should be aware the software had its limitations . &quot; Technology can lead to exceptional learning , but it has to be used in conjunction with other tools , &quot; he said . &quot; If all you are doing is sitting them down and leaving them to experience Shakespeare through Minecraft , you would be doing something wrong . &quot; Dance , art , drama and music remain the best ways to teach kids . &quot; But technology can add to that as an additional tool . &quot; Microsoft said it would allow teachers to start &quot; be@@ ta-@@ testing &quot; Minecraft &apos;s education edition at some point &quot; in the summer &quot; without charge , ahead of its formal rollout .

S-145	Domenico Sc@@ ala , who heads up Fifa &apos;s A@@ d-@@ Ho@@ c Electoral Committee , is Swis@@ s-@@ Italian - as is Gianni Infantino , one of the five presidential candidates . Sc@@ ala exc@@ used himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate , Swiss Sepp Blatter . L@@ FA boss Musa B@@ ility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Sc@@ ala does not withdraw by Thursday . The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days &apos; time . &quot; Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the A@@ d-@@ Ho@@ c Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest ... is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced , &quot; B@@ ility wrote in a letter to Sc@@ ala on Monday . Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Sc@@ ala and Claudio Sul@@ ser , who was also on the A@@ d-@@ Ho@@ c Electoral Committee , stepped aside for this reason . &quot; Prior to the final review process , Domenico Sc@@ ala ( as a dual Swiss / Italian national ) and Claudio Sul@@ ser ( as a Swiss national ) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality , &quot; Fifa wrote at the time . However Andreas Bant@@ el , a spokesman for Sc@@ ala , says &quot; the fact that a member of the ad-@@ hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest . &quot; There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa , &quot; he told BBC Sport . &quot; For the last election period Mr Sc@@ ala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President . Sc@@ ala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential confl@@ icted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base . &quot; For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President . Hence , there is no potential conflict of interest at all . &quot; It remains to be seen whether B@@ ility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport . In his letter to Sc@@ ala , he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election . &quot; Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution , the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa , &quot; B@@ ility wrote . &quot; If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah@@ -@@ Ho@@ c Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down ... with immediate effect , the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes . &quot; B@@ ility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check . On Saturday , the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same . Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino , Frenchman Jerome Champagne , Bahrain &apos;s Sheikh Salman and South Africa &apos;s Tokyo Sex@@ w@@ ale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president . The election , which is voted on by Fifa &apos;s 209 members , will take place in the organisation &apos;s headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich .

S-101	But the study says there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices . The study , commissioned by education technology charity Tab@@ lets for Schools , looked at a representative sample of 6@@ 71 state and independent schools . Many pupils reported that they took an internet-@@ connected device to bed to continue social media conversations . The rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home . Tab@@ lets are now being used , at least to some extent , in 68 % of primary and 69 % of secondary schools , according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family , Kids and Youth research group . But researchers found examples of much more intensive use . In 9 % of schools , there was an individual tablet device for every pupil . The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools . The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present , 45 % reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them . Between 2014 and 2016 , the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 4@@ 30,000 to almost 900,000 . But Dr Clarke , formerly of the University of Cambridge &apos;s education department , says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results . Researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment . But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact . And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be dis@@ engaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families . Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools . &quot; The type of device might change , but it &apos;s not going to go away . It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology , &quot; she said . A separate study from the National Liter@@ acy Trust and Pearson , published on Monday , suggested that tou@@ ch-@@ screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read . It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on tou@@ ch-@@ screen computers rather than printed books . The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people . Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer , a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet &quot; addicts . &quot; About two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them , used for social media or watching videos . Fin@@ dings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children . It showed about 70 % of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home . Simon Mason , head of Hon@@ y@@ wood Community School in Essex , said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor , but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools . Each pupil has an iPad , which remains the property of the school , but pupils can take them home . Using these computers , he says , is about making sure that the school is in &quot; the current century and not the last . &quot; The benefits are &quot; difficult to put into league tables , &quot; he says . But they create a &quot; sense of empowerment &quot; for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel &quot; trusted and valued . &quot; Tab@@ lets are preferable to laptops , he argues , more portable , the right size , tou@@ ch-@@ screen and immediately switched on . The head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work . &quot; I think it &apos;s really important that schools function in the way that the world is , &quot; said Mr Mason .

S-276	The secretary of state was , by all accounts , a member of the &quot; Remain Campaign &quot; lobbying against a US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement . So President Trump &apos;s &quot; Climate Brexit &quot; was a blow to him - in an ironic twist the fossil fuel company he used to head supports the accord while the government he now represents does not . It was also a blow to the State Department , and to diplomacy . How much of a personal setback is not clear because on this , as on other issues , Tillerson kept a low profile . Twenty-@@ four hours after the decision , the only comment he &apos;d made was an aside at a photo-@@ opportunity . He declared that the US would continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and appealed for partners to keep things &quot; in perspective . &quot; Tillerson had previously said the US should &quot; maintain its seat at the table &quot; on international climate conversations , a sensible position for the nation &apos;s top diplomat and one that he reportedly maintained in White House debates on the Paris Agreement . But publicly he showed none of the passion demonstrated by his predecessor , John Kerry , who powered negotiations on the deal . It seems the president &apos;s daughter , Ivanka , took the lead in fighting the corner for the Remain@@ ers . And the role of super-@@ engaged inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ or apparently fell to the climate change scep@@ tic in the administration , Environment Protection Agency head Scott Pru@@ itt , who spoke at the Rose Garden ceremony . Mr Tillerson did not attend , whether out of resignation or as an every@@ day-@@ ac@@ t-@@ of-@@ resistance , we don &apos;t know . A State Department official said only that he was in his office and &quot; maintained his schedule , preparing for his trip today to Australia and New Zealand . &quot; No doubt Pru@@ itt ( and his ally , White House adviser Steve Bannon ) had an easier task than Tillerson , given that he was preaching to a president sympathetic to his economic and nationalist arguments . But the results are another professional blow to the secretary of state . He &apos;s already facing a proposed budget cut that looks to gut his department . And the president &apos;s son-in-law Jared Kushner , who has even less diplomatic experience than he does , has forged a parallel foreign policy track from the White House . Clearly , the Paris withdrawal was also bad news for the State Department , which has yet to issue a statement . Where it once stradd@@ led the front lines of global climate negotiations , it &apos;s now been dropped off the map . The US does remain a member of the UN framework for climate change issues , the UN@@ FC@@ CC , but those meetings have become mostly about the Paris Agreement . Finally , it &apos;s a rejection of a monumental diplomatic effort by more than 190 countries over many years to strike all the balances that needed to be struck . &quot; We have now slapped every country in the world in the face , &quot; says Todd Stern , the US Special En@@ voy for Climate Change in the Obama administration . &quot; We &apos;ve said we know this matters to you a lot , we know this is a huge potentially epic issue for the world , we know that some of you are particularly vulnerable , but we drop out . It &apos;s the worst way you could treat other countries . &quot; To be fair , this is not entirely un@@ travelled ground - remember George W Bush &apos;s decision against rati@@ fying the 1997 Kyoto climate change treaty . But it is more star@@ kly isol@@ ationist , and this is a different Washington - in private chats , international diplomats from across the global spectrum complain that normal channels for getting and giving information at the State Department and White House are still un@@ staffed . They struggle to find the people who can listen to their concerns or tell them what &apos;s going on . So while this will not break alliances , it could be more difficult to pick up the pieces and say we can still be friends . Follow Barbara on Twitter

Born in Cle@@ e@@ thor@@ pes , North East Lincolnshire , Temper@@ ton traced his song@@ writing ability back to his father &apos;s influence . &quot; My father wasn &apos;t the kind of person who would read you a story before you went off to sleep , &quot; he once said . &quot; He used to put a tran@@ sist@@ or radio in the cri@@ b and I would go to sleep listening to Radio Luxembourg , and I think somehow that had an influence . &quot; In the 1970s , after a spell working in a frozen food factory in Grimsby , he answered an advert in Mel@@ ody Mak@@ er magazine for a key@@ boar@@ dist . The band he joined was disco group He@@ at@@ wave , and his songs like Boo@@ gie Ni@@ ghts , Always &amp; Forever and Gro@@ ove Line became big hits for the band in the 1970s . By the time he left the band in 1978 , his tunes had caught the attention of producer Qu@@ inc@@ y Jones , who was looking for songwriters for a new Michael Jackson LP . Temper@@ ton penned three songs for Off The Wall , which became Jackson &apos;s breakthrough solo album - the title track , Rock With You and Burn This Dis@@ co Out . He went on to write three more for follow-up Thr@@ iller - the title track , which became one of Jackson &apos;s signature sm@@ ashes , plus Baby Be Mine and The Lady in My Life . They helped make Thr@@ iller the best-selling album of all time in the US , with 32 million copies sold . His tunes have also been recorded by artists including Anita Baker , Donna Summer , Are@@ tha Franklin and The Brothers Johnson . Temper@@ ton won a Grammy Award in 1990 for his work on Bir@@ dland , from Qu@@ inc@@ y Jones &apos;s album Back on the Block . He was nominated for two Oscars in 1986 for his work with Jones on the soundtrack for The Col@@ or Purple . He once summed up his approach to song@@ writing : &quot; The first criteria is write something you love first , and once you feel those hairs standing up on the back of your hand , you can go to the world . &quot; In a statement released on Wednesday , Warner / Chappell &apos;s Jon Platt said : &quot; His family is devastated and request total privacy at this , the sad@@ dest of sad times . &quot; V@@ oc@@ alist Cha@@ ka Khan , who recorded Temper@@ ton &apos;s tracks with the funk band Ru@@ fus , paid tribute , writing on Twitter : &quot; Thank u 4 your super@@ lative song@@ writing @ Rod@@ Temper@@ ton .

S-363	Mat@@ ching Mod@@ els in London describes itself as &quot; an international tem@@ p agency for beautiful and talented people . &quot; It advertised for a personal assistant with &quot; a classic look , brown long hair with b-@@ c cup . &quot; The Equality and Human Rights Commission ( E@@ HRC ) called it &quot; appalling , unlawful and demean@@ ing to women . &quot; Rebecca Hil@@ sen@@ r@@ ath , chief executive of the E@@ HRC , said it would be writing to Mat@@ ching Mod@@ els &quot; asking for them to clarify their hiring practices immediately . &quot; Meanwhile , women &apos;s equality campaigners said its ads were &quot; straight out of the 1970s . &quot; Sam Sme@@ thers , chief executive of the Fawcett Society , said : &quot; It is extraordinary that they are taking this approach and almost certainly falls foul of equality legislation . &quot; If we ever wonder why the battle for gender equality hasn &apos;t been won , this is a timely reminder . &quot; The agency &apos;s founder Nath@@ alie Jan@@ sen said : &quot; Our clients are important to us - and looks are important . &quot; Another job advert on the agency &apos;s website asks a &quot; sexy female driver &quot; to drive a Porsche Cay@@ enne two days a week for between £ 40,000 and £ 50@@ ,000-@@ a-year for a Knight@@ s@@ bri@@ dg@@ e-based businessman and polo team owner . Employment lawyer James Lyn@@ as , partner at W@@ inc@@ k@@ worth Sherwood , said the advert was &quot; clearly unlawful , &quot; adding anyone could complain to the Equality and Human Rights Commission , who have powers to intervene . He said an employment tribunal could find the use of phrases such as &quot; beautiful and attractive &quot; were really code for &quot; young , &quot; and in reality discriminatory against older women . He added : &quot; A male driver who genuinely wanted the job could submit an application and sue for sex discrimination if rejected . Compensation for such claims is unlimited . &quot; A statement on the agency &apos;s website states : &quot; It is almost politically incorrect to request someone to work for you that is both attractive as well as professionally equipped with the right set of skills . &quot; However , our company understands the importance of having the right people representing your company , because after all , first impressions count . &quot; But Ms Hil@@ sen@@ r@@ ath said : &quot; Mat@@ ching Mod@@ els are right about one thing ; first impressions count , but the important stuff is not about your hair colour . &quot; If they wish to maintain their reputation , they should act like a business in the 21st Century and con@@ sign this type of sexism to the history books . &quot; Under the 2010 Equality Act , it is against the law to say , or imply , that you will discriminate against anyone - including saying that you are unable to cater for disabled workers . Employers are also not allowed to question a candidate &apos;s age , sexual orientation , marital status , number of children or plans to have children , disability , race or religion . As for speci@@ fying clothing sizes , an employer has to be able to show that it is essential to the nature or context of the work . Talking about the personal assistant advert , Ms Jan@@ sen said : &quot; The client who wants the specific cup size is an older gentleman - he has a specific outfit he designed with Christian Di@@ or . He wants a &quot; Jackie O &quot; look . And he wants a lady with a smaller cup size to fit into the outfit . &quot; &quot; I recently had an Indian businessman who interviewed 60 women from my firm . He wanted a blonde , blue eyed , Greek woman . He hired 6 of them to work on his plane . &quot; Mat@@ ching Mod@@ els clients include MTV , Louis Vu@@ it@@ ton , Coca-Cola , the Ren@@ u@@ alt Formula 1 team and Harro@@ ds . Ms Jan@@ sen said she had hired 5,000 people worldwide and pointed out MTV wanted models with tattoos and pierc@@ ings .

S-456	Tunisia had faced expulsion from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations until apologising to Caf for complaints it lodged against the organisation during this year &apos;s Nations Cup . Morocco , meanwhile , were only able to enter the 2017 Nations Cup qualifying draw after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( Cas ) overturned a ban on its participation . We are preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco &quot; We are preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco , &quot; said Moroccan FA chief Fou@@ zi Le@@ k@@ ja@@ a . &quot; We are back after a little break of a few months , but it has not had a big impact . The impact was minimal and we were , along with our Caf colleagues , able to make it pass . &quot; Morocco were punished in February after being replaced as 2015 Nations Cup hosts last November , just two months before the competition began . The North Africans refused to stage the tournament in January 2015 , citing fears over importing the Ebola virus , and asked for a postponement of either six or twelve months instead . Earlier this month , Cas overturned Caf &apos;s ruling and reduced a fine imposed on Morocco &apos;s FA from $ 1m ( £ 67@@ 5,000 ) to $ 50,000 ( £ 34,000 ) . Equatorial Guinea stepped in to stage the 2015 finals , despite having just 64 days to prepare . The host nation was also at the centre of the incident that led to Tunisia &apos;s row with Caf , which the local federation ( FT@@ F ) says is now over . &quot; I am convinced that the page has been turned and that there will no longer by any problems , &quot; FT@@ F vice-president Maher Sn@@ ous@@ si told BBC Sport . See@@ king their first Nations Cup triumph since 2004 , the Tunisians were leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty . The spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time , as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as temp@@ ers flared . The Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response , which prompted African football &apos;s ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup . Contrary to media reports , the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauriti@@ an referee Raj@@ in@@ dr@@ apar@@ sad Se@@ ech@@ urn of corruption . &quot; We never spoke of corruption because we had no evidence , &quot; said Sn@@ ous@@ si . &quot; But we were strongly convinced that the referee sought out an un@@ justifiable penalty , and that perhaps he was influenced by the atmosphere inside the stadium . &quot; &quot; But we never accused either him or any Caf member of corruption . &quot; We simply said the referee was very badly chosen and we contested that a 45-year-old , coming towards the end of his international career , should have been selected . &quot; In our famous letter , we said that the commission in charge of appointing referees had to assume responsibility for appointing a referee incapable of handling the match . &quot; Tunisia &apos;s 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-@@ March led to a rapprochement . &quot; Luckily , with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou , with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference , we &apos;ve managed to turn the page , &quot; said Sn@@ ous@@ si . &quot; We are very happy to be playing the ( 2017 ) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ir@@ oned out . &quot; Following last week &apos;s draw in Cairo , Tunisia will face Togo , Liberia and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde , Libya and Sao T@@ ome in Group F@@ . Should the Tunisians reach the 2017 finals in Gabon , they will reach their thir@@ teen@@ th straight Nations Cup - which would be a record .

S-234	Ashya was being treated in hospital in Southampton when his parents took him abroad without telling staff last year . They ignored medical advice and took him to Prague for proton beam therapy . It was later revealed Ashya did not receive subsequent chemotherapy in Prague , a move the team in Southampton say could jeopardise his recovery . Speaking exclusively to the BBC , Dr Peter Wilson , paediatric intensive care consultant at Southampton General Hospital , said : &quot; We are unsure as to exactly what treatment he is receiving but what we do know is ... every month that goes by that he &apos;s not getting chemotherapy , his outcome worsen@@ s . &quot; There are experts in the country that have already quoted figures of hal@@ ving survival - so survival going from 80 % to 40 % or 50 % , which is quite dramatic . &quot; The Kings &apos; version of events last year sparked a public outcry and staff members in Southampton said they received angry emails , letters and phone calls which , at one stage , forced the hospital to shut its switch@@ board . The King family , who in March said five-year-old Ashya was now cancer free , declined to be interviewed as part of the BBC programme . In March , four months after the proton treatment ended , Brett King told a national newspaper a recent scan showed &quot; no evidence &quot; of the tumour . But cancer experts have told the BBC although it appears Ashya is in remission it is far too early to say he has been completely cured . On@@ cology specialist Professor Kar@@ ol Sik@@ ora said : &quot; Ashya is not completely out of the woods yet , but 78 % of children with this type of rare cancer actually survive and are cured . &quot; The fact he is disease free at this point is great , but it doesn &apos;t mean he is cured yet . &quot; The breakdown in the relationship between Brett King and the hospital stemmed from his belief that Ashya should not receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy following surgery to remove a brain tumour . Mr King claimed in a YouTube video that staff threatened him with a court order if he refused Ashya &apos;s treatment , something the hospital has denied . He told journalists in Spain after his arrest : &quot; They were going to kill him in England or turn him into a vegetable . &quot; Through the media , the King family raised tens of thousands of pounds for Ashya &apos;s treatment before the NHS agreed to pay for proton therapy in Prague . Dr Nicky Thor@@ p , of the Children &apos;s Cancer and Le@@ ukaemia Group of paediat@@ r@@ icians , said : &quot; We were dismayed , but on reflection I can see why NHS England agreed to fund that child &apos;s case . The child was there , the child needed radiotherapy . &quot; The use of prot@@ ons does not improve cure rates of tumours ... and it sad@@ dens me to see the way the truth can be twisted and misunderstood . &quot; In Prague , Ashya &apos;s parents refused the chemotherapy , which had been recommended by doctors and ordered by the High Court . But in March , four months after the proton treatment ended , Mr King said his son was cancer free . Paediat@@ ric on@@ cology consultant Dr Ram@@ ya Ram@@ an@@ u@@ jac@@ har , who was involved in Ashya &apos;s treatment , warned the case could set a worrying precedent . She said : &quot; I don &apos;t think the parents can look after their own child with a brain tumour and be not only the carers but also the professionals directing , managing and dict@@ ating their child &apos;s treatment . &quot; Dr Wilson said the case had led to an &quot; impossible situation &quot; for clinicians faced with families in the same situation . &quot; That is deeply unfair when the NHS is always supposed to be about equal healthcare for all , &quot; he added . Ashya : The Un@@ told Story is to be broadcast on BBC1 in the South region on Friday at 19 : 30 BST .

S-439	Sheikh Ali Salman told the BBC that for national dialogue to be meaningful , the government had to show its willingness to offer &quot; concrete solutions . &quot; &quot; We want someone who can speak for the royal family , &quot; he said . Crown Prince Salman al-@@ Khalifa is seen as a reformist in a court divided on how to respond to opposition demands . Hard@@ liners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-@@ Khalifa , who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies . They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust . However , speaking to the BBC during a visit to London , Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue . &quot; We welcome it , we are ready for it , &quot; he said . &quot; We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary . &quot; The al-@@ W@@ ef@@ aq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties . &quot; A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration , or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family , which until now is still killing people . &quot; But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reform@@ ists within the Sunni Muslim royal family , including the US@@ - and UK-@@ educated Crown Prince Salman , who has has long been considered a pro@@ pon@@ ent of accommodation with the country &apos;s Shia majority . Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council ( GCC ) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011 , the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy . &quot; We had an agreement with the crown prince , &quot; he said . &quot; The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later , GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue . &quot; Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state , Sheikh Salman said he was &quot; hopeful &quot; that he would &quot; do more than his predecessor , &quot; Hillary Clinton . &quot; US policy needs to be more clear and direct . The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices . We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more . &quot; On the UK &apos;s approach to the crisis in Bahrain , the al-@@ W@@ ef@@ aq leader was more blunt . &quot; If the UK government and &#91; Prime Minister David &#93; Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses , then they have to speak out publically . &quot; It is not enough to say : &apos; We are privately urging reform . &apos; That has been done for years . Unfortunately , the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations . &quot; So , the question I would ask the British government is : &apos; S@@ hall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure ? &apos; This is not , I think , a good policy . &quot; Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-@@ W@@ ef@@ aq &apos;s position that it would continue to call for &quot; peaceful demonstrations , &quot; even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain . &quot; It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government . &quot; He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture . They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government . &quot; These people have a lot of followers in the street . If they are not part of the dialogue than the dialogue will fail . &quot;

S-287	Michael Luci@@ w , 27 , from Nottingham , was a passenger in a van that was hit by a Maz@@ da Prem@@ acy , being driven the wrong way on the motorway by Albert Kenneth Newman , who also died . Mr Luci@@ w &apos;s family said retired people should undergo regular driving tests . Age UK said it was &quot; vital &quot; older people could drive for as long as possible . The family described Mr Luci@@ w , the father of a baby girl , as generous , kin@@ d-@@ hearted and a lover of practical jokes . &quot; He had only just turned 27 and he had his whole life ahead of him , &quot; said his mum Andrea Shel@@ ton . &quot; He was looking forward to his baby &apos;s first crawl . Now he will miss all of her life through no fault of his own . &quot; &quot; It doesn &apos;t feel as if we have lost him - it feels as if he has been taken away from us , &quot; said Mr Luci@@ w &apos;s brother Simon . &quot; There are so many things that should be put in place so things like this could be avoided . People are driving that shouldn &apos;t be on the road . &quot; The older you get , the more your reactions slow down . &quot; There needs to be some sort of test introduced , in a car with a driving instructor , so you get a true reflection of how good a driver you are . &quot; You get a free bus pass once you are in your 60s so people can &apos;t say they are going to lose their freedom if they have their licence removed . &quot; Mrs Shel@@ ton said Mr Luci@@ w , a delivery driver , was on a long-distance journey with a colleague Andy Harrington when the crash happened at 02 : 00 GMT on 12 October near K@@ eg@@ worth , Leicestershire . Mr Newman &apos;s car was heading north on the southbound carriageway . Mr Harrington , who was driving the Ford Transit , said he had not seen Mr Newman &apos;s car until the last second . &quot; I managed to swer@@ ve slightly towards the crash barrier but there was nothing I could do , &quot; he said . &quot; You couldn &apos;t even blink that fast . &quot; It lives with me . I still get sleepless nights . It &apos;s not something I will ever forget . &quot; Mr Harrington , who sustained serious injuries in the crash , said retired drivers should have to undergo medical examinations . &quot; It &apos;s up to the government whether they listen to us , &quot; he said . &quot; But if that driver hadn &apos;t been on the road that morning , Michael would still be here with his daughter . &quot; Currently drivers over 70 in the UK must fill in a self-@@ assessment form every three years to renew their licences . The form does not include a medical or driving test . The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency ( DVLA ) which maintains the database of registered drivers said it had no plans to restrict licensing on the basis of age . &quot; Evidence does not show that older drivers are more likely to cause a serious accident than others , &quot; it said . &quot; The rules are clear that all drivers over 70 have to renew their licence every three years and have to tell DVLA about any medical conditions which might affect their driving . &quot; If we find evidence a driver does not meet the appropriate medical standard we immediately remove their entitlement to drive . &quot; Caroline Abrahams , charity director of Age UK , said : &quot; We know driving often allows older people to have the independence to get out and about , go shopping and attend appointments so it &apos;s vital that older people are supported to continue driving safely for as long as possible . &quot; For more on this subject watch Inside Out on BBC One East Midlands at 19 : 30 GMT on Monday 25 January and nationwide for 30 days thereafter on the iPlayer .

S-209	The Scots have won all five qualifiers to date and host Iceland at Falkirk Stadium on Friday knowing victory would all but secure their place . But Evans is desperate not to miss out again after play-off losses for Euro 2013 and last year &apos;s World Cup . &quot; Now that we &apos;re in this position , it would be devastating , &quot; she said . &quot; We &apos;ve been so close and fallen at the last hurdle twice now trying to get to major competitions . &quot; It would be more heartbreak than humiliation . &quot; Iceland , ranked one place above the Scots at number 20 in the world , are also unbeaten after four wins from four , with the outcome of Friday &apos;s contest and the return fixture in Reykjavik on 20 September likely to decide who tops the group . &quot; Obviously reaching the finals is everyone &apos;s aim , &quot; said 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward Evans . &quot; It &apos;s been my aim since I got into the squad , and &#91; veteran goalkeeper &#93; Gemma Fay has been aiming for it for 15 years . &quot; I think it &apos;s going to be emotional if we do get there , although we &apos;re taking it step by step , trying not to think too far ahead . &quot; With the best six of the eight group runners-up also qualifying automatically , Scotland are in pole position to reach next summer &apos;s finals in the Netherlands without the need for a play-off . &quot; Iceland are top seeds in the group , &quot; Evans noted . &quot; They &apos;re a really good side and we &apos;ve always had tough games against them . &quot; But we know we &apos;ve got a really good chance to beat them . &quot; It would be fantastic to have a big crowd at Falkirk . Having the fans behind us makes a huge difference . &quot; Evans is one of 12 players in the current 20-@@ strong squad who play outside Scotland , with five at English clubs , four in Sweden and two at Seattle Reign in the United States National Women &apos;s Soccer League , including newly-@@ crowned BBC Women &apos;s Footballer of the Year Kim Little . Per@@ th-@@ born Evans recently celebrated winning the women &apos;s Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern , rubbing shoulders with the likes of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as they joined the victorious men &apos;s squad for a rap@@ turous reception on the balcony at Munich &apos;s New Town Hall . &quot; It was mind-@@ blowing , completely mind-@@ blowing , &quot; she recalled . &quot; There were thousands of people cheering when we came out . &quot; We had a party with the men &apos;s team on the Saturday night , having been in their stadium on the Saturday just to get congratulated . &quot; I actually walked out with Franck Ribery at the Town Hall , but , in the photos , Arjen Robben is in the background . I don &apos;t know them very well , but they were all really chat@@ ty , really good with us . &quot; Evans , who won four Scottish Women &apos;s Premier League titles and six domestic cups with Glasgow City before moving to Germany with Tur@@ bine Pot@@ s@@ dam , believes the benefits of having more players in the world &apos;s top leagues benefits the national team as they close in on a first major finals . &quot; Germany has been at the top of women &apos;s football for a long time now - it has really developed over there , &quot; she added . &quot; The league is good , arguably one of the best in the world for competitiveness , and we have a hard game every week . &quot; Even within the Bayern set-up , there is such good competition . Just being able to train with those players every day makes you better . I &apos;m really privileged . &quot; The league in Scotland is improving , but the girls playing abroad bring something different . &quot; It is a different culture , a new way of playing , and that adds to the national team . &quot;

S-11	The hosts claimed Australia &apos;s last five wickets for 44 runs on Friday morning to bowl them out for 30@@ 8 and secure a first-innings lead of 122 . Ian Bell and Joe Root both scored 60 and Ben Stokes 42 as England surged further ahead in the afternoon session to the delight of a buoyant Cardiff crowd . And although wickets fell regularly in a frenetic finale , Mark Wood &apos;s unbeaten 32 helped England reach 28@@ 9 all out to set Australia an improbable 4@@ 12 to win . Only two teams in Test history have successfully chased that many runs , with Australia &apos;s best effort the 40@@ 4-3 by Don Brad@@ man &apos;s &apos; Inv@@ in@@ ci@@ bles &apos; at Headingley in 1948 . England set the tone for a near-@@ perfect day with an electric performance on the third morning , executing their plans to perfection to finish off the Australia innings . Shane Watson &apos;s vulnerability to lb@@ ws was brilliantly exploited as Stuart Broad dismissed him for 30 in the second over of the day before Wood pinned Nathan Lyon in front of his stumps . James Anderson found swing with the new ball to induce edges from Brad Hadd@@ in and Mitchell Starc , with Broad removing Mitchell Johnson in between . In little more than an hour , England had advanced from a position of relative strength to one of total control . After a nervy start with the bat - failures for Alastair Cook and Gary Ballance left England tee@@ tering on 2@@ 2-2 - their second innings found momentum . Adam Lyth showed his me@@ ttle with a fluent 37 , but the main catalyst was Bell , who put a dreadful sequence of 56 runs in nine innings behind him with a fine half-century . The Warwickshire batsman went on the front foot from the off , lashing two cover drives in one Mitchell Starc over and pep@@ pering the third-@@ man boundary with his trademark late cut . He reached fifty off 75 balls , and underlined his new-found confidence by crashing Johnson over cover for his 11th four . The next ball brought Bell &apos;s un@@ doing however , as , clearly expecting the short ball , he backed away slightly and was clean bowled to give Johnson his first wicket of the match . By the time of Bell &apos;s dismissal , England were flying and the in-form duo of Root and Stokes kept them airborne , with both finding the boundary nine times . A mini-@@ collapse from 20@@ 7-4 to 24@@ 5-@@ 8 in the last session gave Australia a glimmer of hope , only for England to find inspiration from an unlikely source . Sw@@ inging from the hip , Wood took the lead role in a 43-@@ run partnership for the ninth wicket with Moeen Ali and was still at the crease when Anderson became Lyon &apos;s fourth victim in the very last action of the day . England &apos;s brilliance has set up the possibility of a four-day finish , and the hosts would be wise to do their utmost to wrap things up on Saturday because of heavy showers forecast for Sunday . Australia will no doubt still fancy their chances of pulling off a record-breaking victory , but in reality the Welsh weather represents their best chance of avoiding going into next week &apos;s second Test at Lord &apos;s 1-0 down . Australia spinner Nathan Lyon : &quot; We &apos;re definitely still in it . If we bat two days the result will go our way . There &apos;s no reason why we can &apos;t dig deep . &quot; We &apos;ve got to learn from our first innings with the bat - be more patient . There were too many 30s in the first innings , so we need to try and push on a bit more and have a couple of our top five get big hundreds . &quot; England batsman Ian Bell : &quot; There are no g@@ im@@ mes and we expect more tomorrow . We are going to have to work hard to win . &quot;

S-129	Jak Tru@@ eman , 15 , was suffering from a rare form of blood cancer called gam@@ ma del@@ ta T-@@ cell lymp@@ homa . On Saturday he briefly attended a school prom held in his honour . His mother Allison broke the news of his death on his Facebook page , saying : &quot; Dev@@ ast@@ ated and heartbroken to say my beautiful boy &apos;s gone to Heaven . &quot; She added : &quot; God bless . Jak I am the proudest Mum@@ my ever x@@ x@@ x@@ xx Simply the best x@@ xx . &quot; The West Calder High School pupil had been documenting his life and treatment on social media . Since he was diagnosed with cancer last August , Jak had been posting updates on a Facebook page called Jak &apos;s Journey with the help of his mother , sister Aim@@ ie and girlfriend Hannah Boyd . The teenager &apos;s story of his fight against cancer , and his relentlessly positive attitude , touched the hearts of many people in West Lothian and beyond . The Jak &apos;s Journey page attracted more than 28,000 Li@@ kes and documented the teenage goalkeeper &apos;s love of Rangers FC , and his meetings with former Ibrox stars Neil Alexander and Nacho Nov@@ o and current goalkeeper Cammy Bell . On Saturday , he managed to make it along to his prom for 10 minutes but had to leave as he felt unwell . Jak was greeted at the event by former Rangers captain Barry Ferguson . The teenager wrote on his page : &quot; I would just like to make a massive apology for me only turning up and then having to go again . &quot; I was gutted and really sad as I never spoke to anyone , but I took really unwell really quickly as I had been lying in bed for three days without hardly moving . &quot; Thank you to everyone who organised it and came along . Even just knowing it was all happening for me makes me smile . &quot; At the party , Jak &apos;s family collected the teenager &apos;s Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award and also the Kerry MacGregor Memorial Trophy for overcoming adversity . The Jak &apos;s Journey website highlighted Jak &apos;s stay at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh and York@@ hill Hospital in Glasgow over the past few months . He was visited by players from Celtic , Hibs , Hearts and Edinburgh Rugby and the cast of the musical W@@ icked . Jak and his family also published many other personal moments , including him playing his t@@ uba and visiting his classmates and teachers at school . On 23 January , Jak and his family found out from doctors that his cancer had spread throughout his body . The medics made a decision to not pursue any other treatment . At the time , Jak wrote : &quot; This is the sad@@ dest day of our lives yet but I am going to fight the pain and get as many days / weeks / months / years I can get . They can &apos;t give me a timescale to how long I have . &quot; I am so sorry to give everyone this horrible news but there &apos;s no other way to put it . &quot; I would like to thank all the doctors , nurses and everyone who has helped me over the past six months , they have tried their best for me . &quot; In the days after he received the news , Jak &apos;s family urged people to donate to a fundraising page for Le@@ ukaemia &amp; Ly@@ mp@@ homa Research . After becoming ill Jak also visited the Kel@@ pies , enjoyed a romantic meal with his girlfriend , went to a party in his honour which was attended by Neil Alexander and Nacho Nov@@ o , and spent time in a super@@ car and on a quad bike . More money is expected to be raised for charity on Sunday at a special football match being held at the Energy Assets Arena , home of Livingston FC .

S-181	It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better@@ -off children who commit the same crime . Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls . The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live . The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers . They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predic@@ tor of whether a young person was not in education , employment or training by the age of 18 . Poo@@ rer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better@@ -off counterparts . And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending . This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account , the researchers said . They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime . The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predic@@ tors of violence , with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts . Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime , the authors said . This was the case even after other factors - such as tru@@ ancy , substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account . The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transi@@ tions and Crime , by the University of Edinburgh &apos;s School of Law , has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal . The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles . It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council , the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government . Report author Prof Lesley Mc@@ Ar@@ a said : &quot; Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence . Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty . &quot; As a result , contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently re@@ producing the conditions in which violence can flourish . &quot; Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime . A study by Applied Qu@@ anti@@ tative Meth@@ ods Network ( AQ@@ Me@@ N ) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh &apos;s Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities . Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20 % of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems , the report showed . A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20 % of areas with the highest levels of unemployment . Lead researcher Prof Susan McV@@ ie said : &quot; The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods , and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades . &quot; This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government . &quot; A Scottish government spokesman said : &quot; Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-@@ year low , homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets . &quot; The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â £ 29@@ 6m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government &apos;s welfare cuts . &quot;

S-39	The incident happened on En@@ Qu@@ ests &apos;s Thistle platform , off Shetland , last December . Rig@@ ging supervisor Steve Innes , from Sunderland , told the BBC he and fellow Wood Group contractors discovered they had been exposed to al@@ ph@@ a radiation . En@@ Quest said &quot; additional precautionary steps &quot; had since been taken . Wood Group said it was committed to employee safety . Mr Innes - who said he has struggled to find more work since raising concerns - said the workers now faced cancer fears , and blood tests were ongoing . He said En@@ Quest had failed in its duty of care . The men were working at Thistle , 125 miles ( 201 km ) north east of Shetland , doing shutdown work with pipe equipment . Mr Innes claimed they were told there was a problem two thirds of the way through the trip . He claimed a health and safety manager told them a reading had been taken the night before and all the work was stopped . He said : &quot; We had all been working on it without the proper P@@ PE ( personal protective equipment ) , because they had assumed it was clear . &quot; At first we were all in shock . &quot; We have been exposed to radioactive material for hours at a time . &quot; He said they had been told the levels of radiation may not cause them long-term harm , but he was continuing to undergo tests . Mr Innes said of En@@ Quest : &quot; They have a duty of care . Their procedures have broken down . &quot; You can &apos;t say &apos; you &apos;ve been contaminated but we think you &apos;ll be OK &apos; . &quot; I would like somebody to take the case on who &apos;s not frightened of the companies . &quot; An En@@ Quest spokesperson said : &quot; En@@ Quest can confirm that , in December 2016 , during planned shutdown activities on its Thistle platform , six personnel employed by Wood Group under a contract with En@@ Quest were removing a piece of pi@@ pe@@ work when they were exposed to low levels of NO@@ R@@ M ( naturally occurring radioactive material ) . &quot; The level of exposure was less than 1 % of the level at which it is re@@ portable to the Health and Safety Executive however En@@ Quest advised the HSE of the matter at the time . &quot; En@@ Quest has appropriate control measures in place which are designed to prevent exposure to NO@@ R@@ M . &quot; Following an investigation , additional precautionary steps have been taken to further ensure that personnel avoid any such exposure . &quot; A Wood Group spokeswoman said : &quot; The health and safety of our people is always our top priority . &quot; As a precaution following the incident , we down@@ manned our employees from the platform in order to conduct medical assessments . &quot; We fully supported En@@ Quest in a detailed joint investigation and continue to reinforce the application of our health and safety procedures , to ensure the safety of our employees . &quot; Our commitment and priority following the incident and throughout the investigation has been to the health and wellbeing of our employees . &quot; John Bol@@ and , regional officer for the Unite union , said : &quot; Unite believes that the way these workers has been treated is terrible . &quot; It &apos;s vital for workers &apos; safety that there is openness and transparency about serious safety incidents , so that we can learn lessons and create a safer working environment for everyone offshore . &quot; A spokesperson for the Health and Safety Executive ( HSE ) said : &quot; HSE has been made aware of this incident . &quot; However , it was not re@@ portable under the present RI@@ D@@ DO@@ R system ( Reporting of Injuries , Dis@@ eases and Dangerous Oc@@ curren@@ ces Regulations ) and no staff raised the issue with HSE separately so no investigation has been carried out . &quot;

S-42	Militants armed with guns and grenades gained entry after one detonated explosives at a hospital gate and then opened fire on staff and patients . Comman@@ dos who landed on the Sar@@ dar D@@ aud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting . The so-called Islamic State ( IS ) group has claimed the attack . The Taliban has denied any involvement . More than 50 people were also wounded , the defence ministry said . World powers jos@@ tle in Afghanistan &apos;s new &apos; Great Game &apos; How successful has IS been in Afghanistan ? St@@ uck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-@@ bed hospital &quot; tram@@ pled all human values . &quot; &quot; In all religions , a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan , &quot; he said . The attack began at 09 : 00 local time ( 04 : 30 GMT ) . One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker &quot; wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone , including the guards , patients and doctors . &quot; One employee wrote on Facebook : &quot; Att@@ ack@@ ers are inside the hospital . Pr@@ ay for us . &quot; The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it &apos;s the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital . Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings , mainly of Shia Muslims , as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month . But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter . This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks . If that &apos;s the case , the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months . In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan , IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful , rival Taliban fighters - in the east , near the Pakistan border . It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason , observers suggest , it may now be mounting more head@@ line-@@ grabbing attacks . The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dis@@ lodge them from mountainous areas they control . TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on led@@ ges outside windows on upper floors of the building . More than six hours after the attack began , interior ministry spokesman Se@@ di@@ q Se@@ di@@ q@@ qi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead . The IS-@@ affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies . Afghanistan &apos;s de-@@ facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to &quot; avenge the blood of our people . &quot; IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khor@@ asan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks . In July 2016 , a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people . Three months later , two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ash@@ ura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30 . IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul &apos;s Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan . The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks , killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago , after beginning its Spring offensive early .

S-340	The 25-year-old wing has crossed codes from Super League side Wigan Warriors , in arguably the most high-profile switch since Sam Burgess &apos; move to Bath . Burgess &apos; time in union only lasted a year , but Chor@@ ley-@@ born Charnley is hoping he can take to the game more naturally . &quot; I just want to learn it and not have to ask where I should be stood . I just want to have it free-@@ flowing , &quot; he told BBC Sport . Since his move to Sale was announced in March , Charnley has been to the AJ Bell Stadium to watch the team as much as possible . With his focus on league as a youngster , he did not grow up watching the Premiership , Six Nations or England internationals . &quot; I &apos;ve wanted to try union for a while , &quot; he added . &quot; I &apos;ve been lucky enough to be successful in league and achieve things that not many people can achieve so when the opportunity came to switch codes , I couldn &apos;t turn it down . &quot; I &apos;ve been watching a lot of games and analysing it . It is one of those where I need to watch as much as I can as I need to know what I need to be doing . &quot; Charnley said he was having to adapt to a different way of training and the pace of the game in union . &quot; I was doing some clearing out the other day and it hurt my neck , &quot; Charnley said with a w@@ ry smile . &quot; It is getting my body used to it . I &apos;m used to running between two people and getting up and down and this is different . &quot; It &apos;s good , it &apos;s a new challenge and I &apos;m excited for it all . &quot; He signed off with his hometown club in the perfect way , scoring a try at the Grand Final at Old Trafford as Wigan beat Warrington 12-@@ 6 last month . His stats in rugby league were staggering - 165 tries in 176 appearances - and Sharks director of rugby Steve Diamond does not want to suppress that natural ability to cross the whitewash . &quot; We &apos;re not going to take away anything that he has already got , we can &apos;t enhance that at all at the moment , &quot; said 48-year-old ex-@@ Sale hooker Diamond . &quot; We have a good management structure here . We understand what we &apos;re bringing from one sport to another and the differences in the codes . &quot; We have to settle him in ; we don &apos;t want to rush him in . I think he will be nothing like the Sam Burgess affair that happened . &quot; There is a long line of Wigan players moving to union , and in recent times both Chris Ashton and Joel Tomkins have become cross-@@ code internationals , but still the most successful was Jason Robinson &apos;s switch . England head coach Eddie Jones has spoken about Charnley as having the ability to join the list of players who have represented their country in both codes . &quot; The potential is there , without a doubt , &quot; former Sharks and England winger Mark Cu@@ eto told North West Tonight . &quot; You don &apos;t want to pile the pressure on him but he has the ability to do it , and I &apos;m sure he will . &quot; He has such a good career so far , so as a long as he does that in a Sale shirt then he is always going to have a sniff . &quot; Asked if he thought about running out at Twickenham , Charnley added : &quot; Any player wants to play for their country . You want to put that jersey on . &quot; If I &apos;m lucky enough to be successful enough to get picked then it will be a nice thing on my CV . &quot;

S-423	Bottas , on whom Williams have a contractual hold , is Ferrari &apos;s number one option should they decide not to retain Kimi Raikkonen alongside Sebastian Vettel . Sources close to the deal say Ferrari and Williams have discussed Bottas &apos;s transfer but have no agreement yet . Williams view Button as a leading candidate should Bottas leave . Should the 2009 world champion join Williams in 2016 , it would bring his career full circle . Media playback is not supported on this device He made his F1 debut for Williams in 2000 before moving on to Benetton / Renault , B@@ AR - which became Honda and then Brawn - and finally McLaren in a career in which he has won 15 grands prix . McLaren have not yet decided who they will pick to drive alongside Fernando Alonso in 2016 . The team have a contractual option to retain Button , which means that the 2009 world champion cannot join another team unless McLaren decide not to keep him - or fail to decide until after whatever date is set in the contract as the team &apos;s deadline to do so . Their other options are their Danish reserve driver Kevin Magnussen , who raced for McLaren alongside Button in 2014 , and the Belgian rising star Stoffel Vandoorne , who is leading the GP@@ 2 championship . McLaren have contracts with both men . Williams said they could not comment on driver contracts and Button said he had not yet considered his future . &quot; I &apos;ve had a lot of questions thrown at me about what I am doing next year but I have not thought about anything , seriously , &quot; the 35-year-old said . &quot; I just have to get my head down and concentrate on improving the car and then in a couple of months we will sit down and talk about next year . &quot; Media playback is not supported on this device Bottas , on whom Williams have an option for the next two seasons , said he &quot; did not know &quot; whether he would be at Williams next season . &quot; Nothing is confirmed , &quot; the Finn said . &quot; We have to wait and see . As a driver , you want to know as soon as possible but sometimes you have to wait . &quot; Although Ferrari have pursued various options , sources close to the team say they have decided to put off a decision on Raikkonen &apos;s future until later in the summer . Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne said last month that Raikkonen &apos;s &quot; future is in his own hands &quot; amid concerns at the team that he is not performing well enough compared to team-mate Sebastian Vettel . These come on the back of his poor season in 2014 during which he was comprehensively out-@@ performed by former team-mate Alonso . Ferrari technical director James Allison said this week in an interview with an Italian magazine that Raikkonen was as fast as Vettel but that his results were being affected by the fact he was making more mistakes . Raikkonen said : &quot; I don &apos;t know any more than I knew at the start of the year . For me , the whole thing hasn &apos;t changed for months . If I knew I would easily say . Unfortunately I don &apos;t know . &quot; Somehow I end up every year in the same position , and it makes no difference if I have a contract or not . There is no contract , but there is an option now . &quot; I have made it very clear to the team what I would like to happen , and it is to be here next year . &quot; If Bottas leaves and Button stays at McLaren , Williams may still look to McLaren &apos;s driver pool for a partner for Felipe Massa , on whom they have an option and is expected to stay . Magnussen and Vandoorne could both be of interest to Williams .

S-444	After weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result , Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered . Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor pro@@ ff@@ ered a third . Ex@@ tend , yes , but for just one more year . Super@@ ficially , it appeared to be a rather awkward fud@@ ge . Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to ? Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote ? Or was there another issue weighing on his mind : how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two ? The third , it appears , was the clin@@ cher . When Mr Carney took office in 2013 , the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later ( a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation , Pascal Lam@@ y , as something akin to &quot; taking an egg out of om@@ el@@ ette &quot; ) , was a remote one . But that all changed on 23 June . Beyond trying to stabilise the economy , it also created a personal issue for the Governor . If he left in 2018 as originally agreed , it would be right in the middle of Britain &apos;s exit negotiations . Should he , therefore , extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve ? That might provide a greater level of certainty for j@@ it@@ tery markets . And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed , telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he &quot; wanted to serve &quot; - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years . But , a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions , he started talking about a &quot; third way &quot; - the short extension . The reasons were personal and unique . In 2018 , one of Mr Carney &apos;s four daughters will be finishing her A-levels , and another will be completing her GCSEs . Like everyone , I have personal circumstances that I have to manage . This is a role that requires total attention and devotion . I intend to give that for as long as I can . For his family , this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system . He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week . &quot; To be absolutely clear , it is an entirely personal decision , &quot; he said about whether he would extend his stay . &quot; No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual , imagined , potential , past . It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role . I fully recognise that . &quot; Like everyone , I have personal circumstances that I have to manage . This is a role that requires total attention and devotion . I intend to give that for as long as I can . Those are the only factors . &quot; Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of &quot; tension &quot; with the Prime Minister , who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021 . However , Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision . Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank &apos;s pre-@@ referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin , they add . Profes@@ sionally , Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations . But , with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned , he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year . By then the Article 50 process of dec@@ ou@@ pling Britain from the EU should be complete . It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain &apos;s economic future .

S-79	The Dons boss has guided his team to successive second-place finishes in the Scottish Premiership , and lifted the 2014 League Cup . Going into Sunday &apos;s game against Rangers , Aberdeen are 12 points clear of the Ibrox side in second place . &quot; Derek &apos;s doing everything he can , extracting every ounce out of the club , &quot; Thompson told BBC Scotland . &quot; I thought last summer , could they achieve more than they had done , was it maybe the right time for Derek to go , what else could he do with this Aberdeen team ? &quot; He &apos;s come up tr@@ umps again . If anything , they &apos;ve been better than they were last season . With Rangers in the league , with a stronger Hearts team , they &apos;ve still been the second-@@ top team in Scotland and I think Derek and his players deserve enormous credit for that . Media playback is not supported on this device &quot; Even if Rangers were to win ( on Sunday ) , I don &apos;t think they will finish second . Aberdeen have been so consistent , especially at home , so I fully expect Rangers to lose . &quot; The Dons have made Pittodrie a fortress this season , embarking on a 10-@@ game winning streak on their home patch . They may have been eased aside by all-@@ conquering Celtic in November &apos;s League Cup final , but have the chance to reach another national showpiece when they face Hibernian in the Scottish Cup last four on 22 April . &quot; Derek can &apos;t win the league , not against this Celtic side , &quot; Thompson added . &quot; Success can be measured in other ways . To reach both cup finals would be success in itself , to finish second , to get European football again , to break records - I &apos;m not sure what else he can do . &quot; The consistency they &apos;ve shown in the last two seasons has been phenomenal . I just think there aren &apos;t enough plaudits out there for Derek McInnes and the work he &apos;s done . &quot; Meanwhile , former Rangers player Thompson admits he has been baffled by the actions of new Ibrox boss , Pedro Caixinha . The Portuguese took the unusual step of revealing his team line-up a day before Wednesday &apos;s goalless draw with Kilmarnock , and two days ahead of their showdown with the Dons predicted the starting XI McInnes would select . Media playback is not supported on this device &quot; For me , it &apos;s non@@ sen@@ sical to give the opposition your team , &quot; Thompson said . &quot; It gives them extra time to prepare , and insight into how they &apos;re going to go about beating your side . &quot; I &apos;ve never worked under a manager who would consider giving away his team lines , let alone a day before like he did . I found that puzz@@ ling . &quot; Possibly even more puzz@@ ling was to name the Aberdeen team . I think he &apos;s trying to show he &apos;s done his homework , but you can pretty much name the Aberdeen team because it doesn &apos;t change too often . &quot; If I was Derek McInnes , what would I think of that ? Is it mind games ? It &apos;s not very good mind games , if you ask me . &quot; Thompson , who made over 60 appearances for Rangers , says Caixinha &apos;s care@@ free style sits in stark contrast with the rig@@ idity and structure of his predecessor , Mark Warburton . The 46-year-old led the G@@ ers to a thumping win over Hamilton Academical in his first game in charge , but has since dropped points with successive draws against Motherwell and Kilmarnock . &quot; It &apos;s far too early to be making judgements , &quot; Thompson asserted . &quot; None of these players are Caixinha &apos;s players . I suspect in the summer you &apos;ll see a substantial recruitment drive . &quot; One thing that struck me is he &apos;s not afraid to do something radical . I know he had injury problems , but he took off three of his back-@@ four , completely changed his shape against Motherwell . That raised a few eyebrows , although they got back into the game . &quot; Caixinha looks like he &apos;s going to start taking risks . With that , you have to make sure you &apos;re getting results as well . It won &apos;t happen this season , but if he continues to take risks like he does and he isn &apos;t getting results next season , it won &apos;t be long before he receives criticism . &quot;

S-162	It decided to re@@ organise the way patients were diagnosed by GPs and specialists by bringing in a new approach , especially to deal with those cancer cases which are not initially obvious . A team of cancer specialists , GPs , NHS and public health experts from Wales have just returned from a fact-@@ finding visit to Aar@@ h@@ us , Denmark &apos;s second city . So what was the problem ? Prof Fre@@ de O@@ les@@ en of Aar@@ h@@ us University said the changes followed &quot; quite alarming &quot; cancer survival statistics more than 15 years ago showing Denmark was performing poorly compared to other European countries , including the rest of Scandinavia . Part of the problem was that waiting times patients faced before getting diagnosed were too long . It was not so much the most serious cases where patients came to the GP with obvious symptoms . They could be fast-tracked to specialists in hospital . It was the cancer cases where patients either had vague or more difficult to diagnose symptoms - or the small number of cancers found in patients who said they were ill but mostly needed a quick test or scan to rule something serious out . &quot; We looked at 30,000 cancer cases - and more than 25 % of all cancer cases were from this group where we didn &apos;t think it was something but it suddenly showed as being something and so it &apos;s important to find those cases , &quot; said Prof O@@ les@@ en . What were the changes ? The model of care introduced in Denmark has three routes . First - for patients with &quot; alarm &quot; symptoms of specific cancers - there are fast-track diagnosis and treatment routes with strict time targets . In addition to that , by law , any patient with a physical illness in Denmark must be investigated within 30 days of a GP referral . Second , the Danish health service from 2007 set up diagnosis centres - at existing hospitals and clinics - where patients with symptoms which GPs cannot diagnose are given a range of tests and scans quickly to find out what is wrong with them , whether it is cancer or something else . GP Dr H@@ anne He@@ je , who works in Aar@@ h@@ us - a city slightly smaller than Cardiff - said the new system helps doctors who suspect something is wrong but not necessarily cancer . It also stops the &quot; ping pong &quot; between GPs and different specialists . &quot; Now we know there &apos;s a department meeting the patient with open arms saying &apos; we welcome you &apos; , even though there &apos;s not a diagnosis written on their forehead , &quot; she said . The third route deals with the group of patients with minor symptoms , which are very unlikely to be cancer but in rare cases could be . These patients go to so-called &quot; y@@ es-@@ no &quot; centres which offer a simple test or scan so they can be seen quickly and any problems identified . &quot; This can be solved within hours in some cases but 1 % will have a serious disease and this can be detected , &quot; said Prof O@@ les@@ en . &quot; For these patients before - they might have had to wait four to six months , so for the small percentage where something is found , they &apos;d start treatment six months behind the time schedule . &quot; The results so far Prof O@@ les@@ en - a former GP himself - said the changes have not led to a &quot; flooding of the system &quot; by more GP referrals but better organisation of how patients are diagnosed within existing resources . Importantly , he says it has also led to better survival rates . &quot; We &apos;ve got very optimistic results showing Norway , Sweden and Finland are becoming better year by year , &quot; he said . &quot; But very clearly in the data Denmark is becoming better , a faster pace than before and catching up and getting closer to where we should be . &quot; Denmark has a similar health system in how it is funded and organised to Wales . He said there could be lessons shared between Wales and Denmark on how better organisation can help &quot; in catching up the elite in Europe . &quot; Dr Tom Crosby , medical director of the Wales Cancer Network , said he had been impressed with how the Danish health service had broken down the barriers between GPs and specialists to work better together . He said : &quot; People are not just doing tests in isolation - they are working together to achieve a diagnosis . &quot;

S-138	Arch@@ ery , fencing , weightlifting and wheelchair rugby have also missed out . Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £ 4m to £ 25.@@ 9@@ 8m. Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was &quot; staggered &quot; by the &quot; incomprehensible &quot; decision to remove the sport &apos;s funding . A total of £ 34@@ 5m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £ 2m less than the record £ 34@@ 7m allocated for the Rio Games . As a result , UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 5@@ 1-@@ 85 Olympic medals , and 115-@@ 162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo . Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016 , with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147 . Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government , which provides funding alongside National Lottery money , has &quot; confirmed its commitment &quot; for Tokyo 2020 . He added : &quot; These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained . &quot; Badminton , which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio , is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed . Marcus Ellis and Chris Lang@@ ridge took bronze in the men &apos;s doubles after the sport was given £ 5.@@ 7@@ 4m in the last cycle . Christy said the decision represents a &quot; catastrophic impact on the sport &quot; and Badminton England would &quot; fight for the hopes and dreams &quot; of its players . &quot; How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade , in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track , only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn ? &quot; he said . &quot; What have we done wrong ? &quot; added GB Badminton &apos;s performance director Jon Austin . Judo , which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal , has had its funding increased slightly . Liz Nicholl , CEO of UK Sport , said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly . &quot; We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential , &quot; she said . &quot; If we under-@@ invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately under@@ perform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk . &quot; Sports minister Tracey Crouch added : &quot; UK Sport &apos;s approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing , London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that , if achieved , would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020 . &quot; Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build &quot; performance pathways for future success &quot; was supposed to be aimed at such sports . A British Basketball statement , in conjunction with volleyball and handball , said : &quot; It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development , which was identified in its own review . &quot; With UK Sport &apos;s investment budget approaching £ 350m , it borders on intran@@ sig@@ ence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport . &quot; UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed . Baseball / sof@@ t@@ ball will return to the programme , with kar@@ ate , skate@@ board , sports climbing and surfing also added , while Para-@@ taekwondo and Para-@@ badminton join the Paralympic programme . UK Sport says funding will be determined &quot; following further exploration of medal potential , &quot; with £ 9m of the £ 34@@ 5m total still to be allocated . Liam Carroll , head coach of the GB baseball team , said : &quot; The key to unlocking our potential is investment and I &apos;m pleased that UK Sport has left the door open . &quot; We look forward to the opportunity to impress upon them that getting behind Great Britain Baseball can extend their tremendous track record of investing in Olympic medal contenders . &quot;

S-285	However , the nation seems divided over whether there should be another referendum on independence in the near future . Poll@@ sters Ipsos Mori asked voters to give a score out of 10 to a range of policies which could be implemented by the next UK government . A ranking of one meant it should not be implemented , while 10 meant it should be implemented immediately . Ipsos Mori surveyed more than 1,000 adults between 19 and 25 March . Click here to see the full results . Many of those questioned seemed to favour going beyond the Smith Commission proposals , which suggested that Holyrood should control income tax rates and bands as well as some welfare benefits . Give Holyrood full control of income tax 6.8 Incre@@ ase top rate of tax to 50p 7.2 Incre@@ ase minimum wage to £ 7.@@ 85 8.2 The most popular of the policy statements in this category was that of giving Holyrood the power to increase benefits and old age pensions , which scored 7.3 out of 10 on the scale . Close behind was the notion that the Scottish Parliament should have full control of welfare benefits , with a score of 7.1 . Scots appear to place a greater emphasis on embed@@ ding and extending powers at Holyrood parliament than on holding a second independence referendum . When asked to give a score of between 1 and 10 , where 10 is an important priority and should be done quickly , each of the four issues relating to additional powers for the Scottish Parliament achieved high average scores . Giving Holyrood power to increase benefits and pensions achieved an average score of 7.3 out of 10 , a little higher than devolving full control of welfare benefits ( 7.1 ) , full control of income tax ( 6.8 ) and full control of all policy other than defence and foreign affairs ( 6.5 ) . Interestingly , analysis shows that , for each of these issues , support is higher among groups who are more likely to have voted &apos; Yes &apos; in last year &apos;s referendum . Read Mark &apos;s analysis of the poll . The idea that Holyrood should have full control of income tax was given a score of 6.8 . Still popular , but a bit further down the ranking with a score of 6.5 , was the suggestion that Holyrood should control all areas of policy apart from defence and foreign affairs - what most analysts call full fiscal autonomy . The results of the poll suggested that voters would rather have a referendum on whether or not to leave the European Union than another referendum on Scottish independence . Voters gave the policy statement &quot; hold another referendum on Scottish independence within the next five years &quot; a score of 5.6 out of 10 . Ca@@ p amount paid in welfare to a household 6.3 Lim@@ it numbers coming to live in UK 6.3 Give Holyrood full control of welfare 7.1 The policy statement &quot; hold a referendum to ask people whether they wish to stay in or leave the European Union &quot; was slightly more popular , with a score of 6.1 out of 10 . The idea of stopping immigrants from the rest of the European Union from claiming welfare benefits until they have been in the UK for four years scored 6.8 . The policy of putting a limit on the number of people coming to live in the UK was less popular , with a score of 6.3 . As ever , how much the next government should spend and how much it should tax is proving to be one of the central issues of the UK general election campaign . And there seems to be little doubt as to where the majority of Scots stand on this issue , at least if the evidence of BBC Scotland &apos;s issues poll is to be believed . The poll strongly suggests that : Read Professor Curtice &apos;s analysis of the poll Increasing the amount spent on the armed forces was scored 6.2 . However , renewing and upgrading the Trident nuclear deterrent , came joint last in the poll of priorities , with a score of 4.@@ 0 . The poll also indicated some support for bringing the railways back into public ownership - this scored 6.5 out of 10 . &quot; En@@ suring authorities cannot access personal data unless an individual is suspected of taking part in an illegal activity &quot; was among the most popular policy statements tested , with a score of 7.6 .

S-130	The Electoral Commission said 38 MPs had highlighted people , including students , claiming to have voted twice , which is a criminal offence . It said individual electoral registers run by councils should be better joined up to help identify dupl@@ icate entries . Labour warned against making it harder for young people to register to vote . A record number of 46.@@ 8 million people were registered to vote in the 8 June election , 500,000 higher than in 2015 and also more than the 46.@@ 4 million figure for the EU referendum . Of these , 6@@ 8.7 % actually voted on the day , the highest turnout figure for a general election since 1997 . There was a surge in applications to register to the vote in the days after Theresa May called the snap poll on 18 April and also in the days leading up to the 22 May deadline . In total , 2.9 million applications were received over the six-week period . Several constituencies found that the size of their electorate rose by more than 10 % , including seats with large student populations such as Canterbury , Cambridge , Bristol West and Leeds Central . However , concerns over the number of dupl@@ icate applications - a problem which initially surfaced after last year &apos;s EU referendum - continue to persist . At the moment , there is no direct link between electoral registers , which are held and managed by electoral registration officials around Britain , and the online registration service now used by a majority of people . The two systems use different databases and cannot communicate directly with each other . Between 1 December 2016 and the 22 May deadline , about 4.9 million applications to vote were submitted , the majority of them done online . But the net increase in the number of entries on the electoral register during that period was only 1.4 million , suggesting &quot; a significant proportion of applications are likely to have been dupl@@ icates . &quot; With no way of people checking online whether they are already registered , the proportion of dupl@@ icate applications is estimated to have ranged between 30 % and 70 % in different areas . The watchdog said this had caused significant administration and financial burdens for electoral officials and should be addressed by clearer information on registration sites , including potentially a verification function which it said was used in Australia , New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland . Despite efforts to flag up to people that they did not need to register if they had been sent a poll card or had voted in May &apos;s local council elections , the watchdog said it appeared to have made little difference and urgent action was now needed . &quot; The relative ease of submitting an application to register to vote using the online service , in comparison to the difficult of contacting a local authority electoral services team by telephone or email to check if they were already registered , meant many people simply submitted another application , &quot; the report said . Although there was a lack of evidence to back up claims on social media that some people had voted twice , the watchdog said it took the issue very seriously and anyone with information should contact the police . It stressed that although some people - including students and those with second homes - may lawfully be able to register in more than one constituency and cast more than one vote in local elections , voting twice in a general election was an offence punishable by an unlimited fine . The &quot; dispersed and unconnected &quot; nature of the 38@@ 1 electoral registers in Britain means it is not possible to collectively cross-@@ check entries , the watchdog said , and being able to do so would significantly reduce the risk of double voting . It is also calling for people who are registered in two seats to choose in advance which one they will vote in at future general elections . Labour &apos;s shadow minister for voter engagement , Cat Smith , said voting twice was a serious offence and police needed to have the resources to prosecute people suspected of doing so . But she warned against a knee-jerk reaction , given the rise in registration and turnout , particularly among younger voters . &quot; A blanket ban on being registered at two addresses would exclude those who for reasons of work or study need to be registered in two places , &quot; she said . &quot; This cannot be an attempt to make it harder for young people and students to register to vote . &quot;

S-479	Children in P@@ 6 and P@@ 7 will learn how to cope with change under the Healthy Me programme developed by Northern Ireland charity , Action Mental Health . Its chief executive David Bab@@ ington said it will help prepare pupils for the stresses of the transfer test and big changes in their educational life . Five schools took part in a pilot . The charity is now hoping the programme will be rolled out in schools across Northern Ireland . It consists of &quot; interactive workshops &quot; in which pupils are made aware of the importance of emotional wellbeing ; encouraged to seek help if they are in distress and helped to identify sources of support . The workshops also provide teachers with basic training in promoting emotional wellbeing . The Healthy Me initiative was launched at Carrick Primary School in Lurgan , County Armagh , on Friday morning . The school &apos;s pastoral care co-ordinator , Helen Hamilton , is also its P@@ 7 teacher and said the programme has helped pupils and parents ahead of the big move . &quot; I see the anxiety in kids starting to build about secondary school , &quot; Ms Hamilton told BBC News NI . &quot; No fault of the secondary school - they &apos;re excellent and many are very excited to be going there - but they &apos;re apprehensive too and a lot of the time , that can be fed down from parents as well , they &apos;re worried about them . &quot; You &apos;re going from a very close-knit family atmosphere in a primary school - where you have one teacher who sees a child every day all day , and gets to know them and their wee quir@@ ks and can spot very quickly if they &apos;re out of sorts - to the very difficult job of senior school teachers who see them maybe for half an hour . &quot; It &apos;s more difficult for them to pick up on those things , much as they try , so parents sometimes need the reassurance and understanding that the transition can be easier than they expect . &quot; Getting a place in a secondary school can be source of stress however , and last month , thousands of P@@ 7 pupils began to sit this year &apos;s unofficial transfer tests , set by two different examination bodies , the Association of Quality Education ( AQ@@ E ) and G@@ L Assessment . Pupils have the choice to sit either test , both tests , or none , but figures provided to the BBC by the two organisations indicated a slight rise in the number of entrants sitting the tests this year , with a total of 14@@ ,6@@ 81 , a rise from 14@@ ,5@@ 75 in 2015 . &quot; Transi@@ tion from primary to secondary school is a particularly stressful time for children and we believe that targeting the programme at P@@ 6 / P@@ 7 children will help them cope with this transition , &quot; Mr Bab@@ ington said . &quot; Modern life is stressful and can impact on mental health , so implementing strategies for protecting children from stress and helping them learn to cope with change is an extremely positive influence on their young lives , &quot; the Action Mental Health boss added . Ms Hamilton said that in the workshops , children were taught breathing exercises , and &quot; how to relax , &quot; including how to take time out from busy after-@@ school activity regimes . &quot; We , as a school , value so much the amount of evidence that shows that children who , mentally and emotionally , aren &apos;t ready to learn cannot progress , so it &apos;s so important for us that children &apos;s social and emotional needs are met , &quot; the P@@ 7 teacher added . The need to &quot; strengthen the resilience of young people &quot; is one of the key challenges facing Northern Ireland &apos;s education system , according to the chief inspector of schools , No@@ elle Bu@@ ick . &quot; All young people need to build resilience , &quot; she wrote in her latest report , published last month .. The chief inspector said pupils were facing &quot; complex challenges &quot; because the &quot; social context of relationships , values , attitudes and behaviours in which children and young people live and learn has changed significantly &quot; in recent years . &quot; It is timely to review the need for strengthening the resilience of children and young people at all levels through stronger and more explicit preventative education within the wider taught pastoral care curriculum . &quot;

S-405	In an interview with newspaper Die Ze@@ it , H@@ itz@@ l@@ sperger said he was coming out to advance discussion of a topic that was &quot; simply ignored &quot; in German football . He is the most prominent footballer to publicly reveal his homosexuality and his former team-mates were quick to praise his announcement . Arsenal and Germany forward Lukas Pod@@ olski wrote on Twitter : &quot; Respect to Thomas H@@ itz@@ l@@ sperger ! That was a courageous and correct decision and an important step . &quot; And retired defender Ar@@ ne Fried@@ rich , who played with H@@ itz@@ l@@ sperger at Euro 2008 , wrote : &quot; Proud of you Thomas . A good decision and in my opinion the right time . &quot; There was also support for H@@ itz@@ l@@ sperger from leading figures in German football administration . &quot; Finally , a footballer has the courage to make his sexuality public , &quot; said Theo Z@@ wan@@ z@@ iger , the former president of the German Football Association . Bundesliga president Rein@@ hard Ra@@ ub@@ all said in a statement : &quot; The decision of Thomas H@@ itz@@ l@@ sperger to be the first prominent footballer to make public his homosexuality is - even after his active career - a huge and courageous step , and surely leads the way in the fight against homophobia . &quot; Gary Lineker ‏ @ Gar@@ y@@ Lineker Congratulations to Thomas H@@ itz@@ l@@ sperger on bravely being the first player to have played in the PL to &apos; come out &apos; Joseph Barton ‏ @ Jo@@ ey@@ 7@@ Barton 15m Thomas H@@ itz@@ l@@ sperger has shown a lot of courage today . Sad times when people have to wait till they retire from their chosen profession ... ... before the feel other people will judge them solely on who the human being is . Shame on all of us as a society . John Ama@@ echi OBE ‏ @ John@@ Ama@@ echi Congratulations to Thomas H@@ itz@@ l@@ sperger - welcome to the club ! Bayern Munich , the club where H@@ itz@@ l@@ sperger began his career as a junior , also tweeted their support for the midfielder &apos;s &quot; brave step . &quot; H@@ itz@@ l@@ sperger &apos;s announcement is seen as a watershed moment in Germany , which like England has struggled with the problem of homophobia in football . Z@@ wan@@ z@@ iger admitted that football was &quot; now as ever a hard business , where unfortunately an open discourse about homosexuality is still not taken for granted . &quot; Current Germany captain Philipp Lahm created controversy in 2011 when he wrote in his autobiography that he would encourage gay footballers to keep quiet about their sexuality . &quot; I would not encourage any gay professional footballer to come out , &quot; he wrote at the time . &quot; I would fear that he would end up like Justin F@@ ash@@ anu &#91; the English footballer who killed himself after revealing that he was gay &#93; . &quot; The last German footballer to come out was second tier player Marcus Urban , who told Die Welt in 2007 that he knew of at least three gay footballers in the Bundesliga who were too scared to reveal their sexuality . German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s spokesman Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert praised H@@ itz@@ l@@ sperger for going public . &quot; It &apos;s good that he &apos;s spoken about something which is important to him , &quot; Sei@@ bert told a media briefing . &quot; We live in a country where nobody should be worried about making his sexuality known or concerned about intolerance . &quot; We judge footballers on whether they have behaved well and worth@@ ily on and off the pitch and I believe that both are the case with Mr H@@ itz@@ l@@ sperger . &quot; Open@@ ly Gay German politician Vol@@ ker Beck said he hoped H@@ itz@@ l@@ sperger &apos;s announcement would encourage others to do the same . &quot; I hope that H@@ itz@@ l@@ sperger &apos;s courageous step contributes to finally breaking down this taboo , &quot; he said . &quot; It &apos;s now the job of the German FA to embol@@ den active players &#91; to do the same &#93; . &quot; And Z@@ wan@@ z@@ iger said he was optimistic that H@@ itz@@ l@@ sperger &apos;s announcement would lead to greater openness about sexuality in German football . He said : &quot; I &apos;m confident that sexual orient@@ ations will soon not be an issue in football at all . &quot;

S-376	However , there were people in the TV industry who thought the cast would struggle to find work once their time on the show was up . Some of the actors were warned that they wouldn &apos;t be able to shake off their sul@@ ky , angry , teen characters . But when you look at the careers of De@@ v Patel and Jack O &apos;Connell for example , they couldn &apos;t have been more wrong . K@@ aya Sc@@ od@@ el@@ ario was one of the longest-serving members of the cast , appearing in series one to four as E@@ ffy Ston@@ em . She went on to appear in sci-fi thriller Maze Run@@ ner and is now in Australia filming the next instalment of Pirates of The Caribbean with Johnny Depp . Nicholas Houl@@ t was the only member of the main cast who had serious acting experience . He &apos;d starred in About a Boy with Hugh Grant in 2002 . He has since gone on to play Beast in the X-Men pre@@ qu@@ els and will soon be seen starring opposite Krist@@ en Stewart in a film called Equ@@ als . De@@ v Patel &apos;s first job after playing Anwar Khar@@ ral in series one and two , took him from London to India and to the Oscars with Slum@@ dog Milli@@ onaire . He told Newsbeat , he never would have got that role without S@@ kins . &quot; My career started off because Danny Boyle &apos;s daughter was a fan of the show , that is how I got an audition for Slum@@ dog . &quot; He has two films out in cinemas at the moment , The Second Best Ex@@ otic Mar@@ ig@@ old Hotel with Dame Judi Dench and Chapp@@ ie , starring alongside Sig@@ our@@ ney Weaver and Hugh Jackman . Jack O &apos;Connell , who played Cook in series three and four , was hand-@@ picked by Angelina Jolie to star in her most recent movie Un@@ broken . The 24-year-old also picked up the Rising Star Award at this year &apos;s Baftas . Fans of Game of Thrones will be familiar with Joe Demp@@ sie and Hannah Murray who play G@@ end@@ ry and G@@ illy respectively . It is , of course , not unusual for an actor from a British television show to find success in Hollywood films . What is unusual is the amount of stars that were discovered from one single teen drama on a digital channel . So how were the makers of S@@ kins able to spot so many talented young actors ? Co-@@ creator Bryan El@@ sley told Newsbeat they made a conscious decision to hold open auditions . &quot; There are really good kids working from agencies and drama schools but just on that one occasion we decided to go a different way , &quot; he explained . &quot; We felt if we had young people playing characters the same age as themselves , and those actors weren &apos;t too trained , it would have a more natural feel . &quot; It sounds quite risky , but Bryan said the show was such a small project to begin with , they were able to take that approach . Jack O &apos;Connell credits the whole team for the actors &apos; future success . &quot; I think they knew if they were going to identify that genre , that era , that generation , they needed people on the ground level , &quot; he said . &quot; A writing team that understood , they got that right first and then I guess they chose to cast exciting people . &quot; I feel very fortunate to be involved in the show but I don &apos;t think it was a coincidence that we all came through there . &quot; Piers Wenger is the head of drama at Channel 4 and he thinks it was the opportunities the cast had to stretch themselves that helped nurture their talent . &quot; They had the opportunity to do properly complex &#91; roles &#93; , rather than just two dimensional ones , &quot; he said . &quot; It is extraordinary , in the past soap oper@@ as had been the sort of places where young people had been able to do their first job . &quot; That would have been your only break , but time &apos;s are changing . &quot; I think thanks to shows like S@@ kins , unconventional approaches to casting are becoming more and more common . &quot; Follow @ BBCNewsbeat on Twitter , BBCNewsbeat on Instagram and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube

Bradford dominated the rest of the opening period as the visitors &apos; defence survived a series of narrow escapes . Keeper Connor Ripley made a brilliant one-handed save to deny winger Mark Marshall , Timothee Dieng and Josh Cullen both had shots deflected for corners , and Billy Clarke missed a good chance when he turned James Meredith &apos;s cross wide . Oldham somehow held their lead until half-time , but Bradford deservedly equalised after 57 minutes when Ousmane Fane dragged Cullen to the ground and Clarke scored from the spot .

S-379	The former five-@@ weight world champion submitted a necessary wai@@ ver to the Nevada Athletic Commission ( N@@ AC ) on Wednesday , hours before the deadline . The N@@ AC , which sanctioned the bout , told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday . N@@ AC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10@@ oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August . Li@@ ghter gloves offer less cushi@@ oning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing . Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating : &quot; I &apos;ll be wearing 8@@ oz Grant gloves . &quot; But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary wai@@ ver document at that stage . Instead , his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves ent@@ ailed . At the time , N@@ AC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8@@ oz gloves at 15@@ 4@@ lbs before . Rules state that 10@@ oz gloves are used from 13@@ 5@@ lbs upwards but bouts between 13@@ 5@@ lbs and 14@@ 7@@ lbs can use 8@@ oz gloves if wai@@ vers are signed and the N@@ AC feels the move is justified . &quot; Even if they are both in agreement , our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters , &quot; said Bennett . &quot; To devi@@ ate from our regulations at a difference of 7@@ lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine . &quot; During his UFC career , McGregor has used 4@@ oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather &apos;s Instagram post last week , stating : &quot; I am coming sprinting at you with bricks . Know that . Brit@@ tle hands . &quot; The N@@ AC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision . McGregor , 29 , will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history . The UFC lightweight champion &apos;s move from the oc@@ t@@ agon to the ring to face Mayweather , 40 , has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoy@@ a and Gennady Golovkin . But Bennett says he studied a &quot; lit@@ any of information &quot; on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were &quot; several reasons to approve the fight . &quot; Bennett said that McGregor &apos;s UFC rival N@@ ate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion . &quot; I spoke to Virgil Hunter , who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward , &quot; said Bennett . &quot; He used N@@ ate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer . &quot; Then you put N@@ ate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots . Add in that Conor has a gran@@ ite-@@ like chin , add in that he &apos;s 12 years younger than Floyd , and add in that he &apos;s taller and longer . &quot; Floyd is probably one of the smar@@ test fighters , he has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out . But he hasn &apos;t knocked anyone out in 10 years . Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when he K@@ O &apos;d Victor Or@@ ti@@ z in 2010 , he wasn &apos;t defending himself . &quot; That in essence is it . There were several reasons to approve this fight . &quot; McGregor floored Diaz three times on his way to a points win in August 2016 , aveng@@ ing a defeat via submission five months earlier . Since sanc@@ tioning the fight , Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor &apos;s progress and told BBC Sport : &quot; He &apos;s good to go . &quot; He also advised McGregor &apos;s camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules , advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cor@@ te@@ z , 73 . Cor@@ te@@ z said he oversaw an &quot; out of control &quot; sparring session between McGregor and Pau@@ lie Mal@@ ign@@ aggi . The former two-@@ weight world champion has since left the camp after reacting angrily to images of him on the canvas during a sparring session .

S-119	The government wants some households to pay more to raise money for education , and finance secretary Derek Mackay gave evidence to committee backing the plan . The committee formally recommended the scheme to parliament after members voted four to two in favour of it . Members also rejected an amendment from Green MSP Andy Wight@@ man noting &quot; concerns &quot; about wider local tax plans . The proposals would see the average band E household pay about £ 2 per week more , and the average household in the highest band ( H ) about £ 10 a week more . Parliament has to pass an order , a piece of secondary legislation , to change the bands , and Mr Mackay has now won the formal backing of the committee for that . Members will submit a report to parliament , before the order is voted on by all MSPs at a later date . Putting forward a motion to have the committee recommend the move to parliament , Mr Mackay told its members that his plans would lead to a &quot; more progressive &quot; and &quot; fairer &quot; system of local taxation . Mr Wight@@ man lodged an amendment to the finance secretary &apos;s motion to &quot; note concerns &quot; about the fact the council tax base has not been updated since 1991 and recognising the recommendation of the Commission on Local Tax Reform that &quot; the present council tax system must end . &quot; Labour &apos;s Elaine Smith backed Mr Wight@@ man , saying the committee should &quot; reflect the evidence &quot; heard from members . But SNP and Conservative members united against the amendment , with Tory Graham Simpson saying there &quot; isn &apos;t much point &quot; to adding it to the debate . Mr Simpson also opposed Mr Mackay &apos;s original motion , saying it represented a &quot; fundamental change &quot; to the way local services are funded , and undermined local accountability . The motion ultimately passed by four votes to two , with Ms Smith joining the three SNP members and Mr Wight@@ man abst@@ aining . The committee will now compile a report on the issue for parliament , while it will be down to the parliamentary bureau to decide if there needs to be a further chamber debate on the issue as well as a vote . The government was only saved from a chamber defeat over council tax in September when Labour leader Kezia Dugdale &apos;s vote failed to register . Opposition members had successfully amended a government motion promoting its council tax reform strategy , changing the wording to condemn the approach as undermining local accountability . But the final vote on the amended motion was tied after Ms Dugdale &apos;s vote was not counted . Mr Wight@@ man had also called for a revaluation of council tax bands during the committee debate , pointing out that the current bands were based on property values dating back to 1991 . The Green MSP said he had a constituent whose flat was in band E , but was worth £ 20,000 less than neighbouring flats in band B. Labour &apos;s Elaine Smith pointed out that some council tax payers weren &apos;t even born when the council tax values of their properties were determined . Mr Mackay said a &quot; costly &quot; revaluation would &quot; take time &quot; and could be a &quot; shock &quot; to many households - with some potentially facing &quot; astronom@@ ically high &quot; tax increases under a full revaluation . But he said the changes to bands were &quot; not the end of the story in terms of local tax &#91; reform &#93; , &quot; saying the government was taking a &quot; balanced approach &quot; while seeking to &quot; make council tax more progressive . &quot; The Scottish government has started the process of reforming local taxation following on from the Commission on Local Tax Reform , which called for a fairer , more transparent and progressive tax to fund local services . Opposition members have accused the government of &quot; tinkering &quot; with the system rather than making bold reforms . The Scottish Conservatives support an end to the council tax freeze and increases to the top two bands , but oppose the changes to bands E and F@@ . But Labour and the Greens both want to see the &quot; hated &quot; council tax scrapped , with Labour repeatedly accusing the SNP of abandoning an earlier promise to do so .

S-214	It also warns that Britain may have to allow EU-@@ registered boats to fish in UK waters as part of an overall deal . F@@ ishing regions around the UK voted heavily in favour of leaving the EU during the referendum campaign . The Lords review says these communities are at risk of being marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations . The EU &apos;s Common Fisheries Policy ( C@@ FP ) , with its quotas and principle of equal access to commercial fishing grounds for boats from all member states , has often been characterised by the industry as a disaster for Britain . This dislike helped mobilise many in the industry to campaign for a leave vote in the referendum last June . Many in the fishing community argue that Brexit now offers the industry the chance to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish@@ -@@ exporting nation , like Norway . However , the House of Lords European Union Committee has released a report that looks at the risks and opportunities for the UK industry . Since UK fishing only produces a half of one percent of GDP and employs just 12,000 fish@@ ers , the Lords say that industry might be a low priority for the government but it &quot; must not be marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations . &quot; What compl@@ icates the picture is the fact the most commercial fish stocks are in waters that are shared between the UK and other EU coastal states . The vast majority of UK fish are exported , mainly to the EU while a significant proportion of the fish that British consumers eat is imported , often from EU states . &quot; A successful industry , &quot; the report says , &quot; therefore needs continued market access . &quot; However , that access may come at a price . &quot; Brexit will involve many trad@@ e-@@ offs , &quot; said Lord T@@ ever@@ son who chairs the Lords EU Energy and Environment sub-committee . &quot; It may very well be that EU member states demand more access to UK waters than some fish@@ ers would want in return for our continued rights to sell fish to the European market with zero tariffs . &quot; The report also points to the fact that many elements of the C@@ FP should be retained post-Brexit and the UK should ensure that total allow@@ able catches and quotas should continue to be based on scientific advice . The UK will also continue to be under international obligations to co-operate with neighbouring states . One area of concern , according to the report , may well be that if Britain leaves the EU , the C@@ FP framework which treats the UK as one entity will fall away &quot; raising the potential of four different fisheries management regimes &quot; in England , Wales , Northern Ireland and Scotland . However , many in the fishing industry still argue that Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats . Just this week , the EU announced agreement on new quotas under the C@@ FP - many analysts say that it marked an advance for the UK with significant increases in allow@@ able catches for pla@@ ice , had@@ dock and praw@@ ns . Responding to the new quotas , representatives from the industry said they believed this aug@@ urs well for the future of British fishing outside the EU . &quot; With Brexit now looming , fishermen can look to the future with real optimism as we are on the cusp of an exciting new era as a coastal state with full control of our 200-@@ mile exclusive economic zone , &quot; Bertie Armstrong , chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen &apos;s Federation said in a statement . &quot; This will give us the opportunity for fairer shares in catching opportunity and better fit-@@ for-@@ purpose sustainable fisheries management , which will benefit our coastal communities . &quot; In response to the report , a government spokesperson said : &quot; As we enter the EU negotiations , the prime minister has been clear we want to ensure British companies have the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market . &quot; &quot; At the same time , leaving the EU is a real opportunity to review fisheries management in order to ensure fair access to quota , sustainable stocks and a healthy marine environment . &quot; Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook

S-265	Gen Sir Nicholas Houghton told the BBC &apos;s Andrew Marr that refusing to launch nuclear weapons would &quot; seriously undermine &quot; Britain &apos;s &quot; deterrent . &quot; And he said he would be worried if such a view &quot; translated into power . &quot; Mr Corbyn called on the defence secretary to &quot; take action &quot; against Sir Nicholas over his comments . In a statement , the Labour leader said : &quot; It is a matter of serious concern that the chief of the defence staff has today intervened directly in issues of political dispute . &quot; It is essential in a democracy that the military remains politically neutral at all times . &quot; By publicly taking sides in current political arguments , Sir Nicholas Houghton has clearly breached that constitutional principle . Accor@@ dingly , I am writing to the defence secretary to ask him to take action to ensure that the neutrality of the armed forces is upheld . &quot; Mr Corbyn , a leading member of the Campaign for Nuclear Dis@@ armament , sparked a row with his shadow cabinet at his party &apos;s annual conference when he revealed that would never press the &quot; nuclear button &quot; - and he has since praised Scottish Labour &apos;s rejection of Trident . Mr Corbyn has said he was elected Labour leader on a platform of opposing Trident renewal and that he is committed to &quot; promoting an international nuclear weapons convention which would lead to a nuclear@@ -free world . &quot; Asked about Mr Corbyn &apos;s refusal to use nuclear weapons , Sir Nicholas said : &quot; It would worry me if that thought was translated into power as it were . &quot; He added : &quot; The whole thing about deterrence rests on the credibility of its use . &quot; When people say you &apos;re never going to use the deterrent , what I say is you use the deterrent every second of every minute of every day and the purpose of the deterrent is that you don &apos;t have to use it because you successfully deter . &quot; If a prime minister said they would never press the nuclear button , &quot; the deterrent is then completely undermined , &quot; he added . &quot; Most of the politicians I know understand that and I think that , dare I say , the responsibility of power is probably quite a sobering thing and you come to a realisation , &apos; I understand how this thing works &apos; . &quot; Atten@@ ding a wre@@ ath@@ -@@ laying ceremony in his Islington North constituency following the Remembrance Sunday commemorations at the Cenotaph , Mr Corbyn said Sir Nicholas &apos;s comments had been &quot; unhelpful . &quot; &quot; I would gently say to him , with the greatest of respect , we live in a democracy where politicians are elected to Parliament in order to take political decisions , &quot; he told Channel 4 News . &quot; If he &apos;s worried , I think he should talk to me about it . I don &apos;t think it is appropriate for serving officers to make political comments or engage in political debate . &quot; Shadow defence secretary Maria Eagle told Andrew Marr she was leading an &quot; open-minded &quot; review of the policy in light of Mr Corbyn &apos;s views and a vote by Scottish Labour against the renewal of Trident . She said she had yet to meet Mr Corbyn to discuss Trident but a date was in her diary . But she appeared to back Sir Nicholas , telling Andrew Marr : &quot; I understand the point that he is making . It is the point that I made myself when Jeremy said what he said . &quot; She defended the right of Britain &apos;s most senior military figure to speak out on such a politically sensitive issue . &quot; I don &apos;t think there is anything wrong with him expressing himself in those terms , &quot; she said . She indicated she could resign if there was any change to the party &apos;s current position in favour of renewing the Trident submarine fleet . &quot; I am not a unilateral nuclear dis@@ armer . I don &apos;t believe that that works . &quot; I think I would find it difficult &#91; to continue in the shadow cabinet &#93; but we are not there yet . We have got a big process to go through , &quot; she said .

S-225	Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise £ 4.5bn a year . That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes , the report said . Labour said new homes were urgently needed but &quot; driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods &quot; was not the answer . In its En@@ ding Ex@@ pen@@ sive Social Ten@@ ancies report , Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kick@@ start . Neil O &apos;Brien , the think tank &apos;s director , told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal , but there would just be &quot; less of it . &quot; &quot; The truth is I don &apos;t believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town . &quot; People do have a right to get housed , just not in the very most expensive areas , &quot; he said . He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing , currently around 1.8 million , could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented . The prime minister &apos;s official spokesman said : &quot; This is something that councils can choose to do already . &quot; Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can . The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years . &quot; They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently . &quot; If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people , then that is certainly something they should look at . &quot; But Labour said the coalition &apos;s &quot; failed &quot; polic@@ es were &quot; making the housing crisis worse not better . &quot; Shadow housing minister Jack Dro@@ m@@ ey said : &quot; Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitr@@ arily sell off social homes , breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods . &quot; He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and &quot; put unemployed builders back to work &quot; and boost the construction industry . &apos; Lucky family &apos; Ex@@ pen@@ sive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 2@@ 1.8 % of the total social housing stock in the UK , it says . This equates to 8@@ 16,000 properties - out of a total of 3.@@ 78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £ 15@@ 9bn if sold . It says London alone has more than £ 70bn of expensive social housing . About 3.5 % of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying , the think tank said . This meant the government could sell a total of 28@@ ,500 properties each year , raising £ 5.@@ 5bn a year . The figure would stand at £ 4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock , the report said . Mr O &apos;Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nic@@ er area or in a bigger house but could not afford to . &quot; Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house , you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing , now having a roof over their heads . &quot; That seems fairer to me , &quot; he added . The think tank also said the move would be &quot; extremely popular &quot; with all sections of society , claiming that 73 % of people , including social tenants , think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority . &apos; Dram@@ atic erosion &apos; Critics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets , and into new gh@@ et@@ tos . The National Housing Federation , which represents housing associations , says many towns would be &quot; clean@@ sed &quot; of &quot; hardworking people who can &apos;t afford to pay high prices . &quot; Labour MP Karen Buck , who represents Westminster North , is concerned that lower income families , particularly in London , will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor . Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government &apos;s £ 8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60 % when the coalition came to power . Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced &quot; radical reforms &quot; to &quot; get Britain building &quot; and to reduce social housing waiting lists . They included investing £ 19.@@ 5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme &quot; set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes . &quot; Councils could now offer fixed-@@ term ten@@ ancies to new tenants to make sure &quot; social housing goes to those in greatest need , &quot; he added .

S-16	The event on 27 May offers 46@@ - or 9@@ 5-@@ mile routes sn@@ aking through the scenic Tr@@ oss@@ achs and the Camp@@ sie F@@ ells north of Glasgow . The ride will raise money to develop young Scottish cycling talent acknowledge the fabulous contribution made to Scottish and British cycling by Millar , who was born in Glasgow in 1958 . His fourth-placed finish in the 1984 Tour de France was a record for a British rider and has since been matched only by Bradley Wiggins in 2009 . For three of the organisers , the spor@@ tive is the perfect way to celebrate Millar &apos;s achievements . They hope it will safeguard his legacy . Billy Bil@@ s@@ land , Brian Smith and David Lang are respected figures in the Scottish cycling scene . Millar was a pupil of Bil@@ s@@ land &apos;s at his circuit training classes in Glasgow in the late 1970s . A veteran of the professional continental racing circuit , Bil@@ s@@ land and fellow Glasgow Wheel@@ ers stalwart Arthur Campbell helped nurture the fiercely ambitious Millar and set him on his way to France . Smith , now manager of the En@@ d@@ ura racing team , trained with Millar when his hero returned home from racing across mainland Europe . He picked up the Scots pro baton that was handed from Bil@@ s@@ land to Millar and raced in the same Motorola team as Lance Armstrong . He is a trusted friend of the enigmatic Scot - and a cycling nut . &quot; Did@@ n &apos;t I see you win the Glasgow@@ -@@ Dun@@ oon race in the &apos; 80s ? &quot; I wondered . Smith , from Paisley and now based in Kent , replied that he had indeed won , aged 18 and at his first attempt - and he could even remember the gear combination he used in the final 25-@@ mile section . Media playback is not supported on this device Lang , who captains Millar &apos;s former club , the Glasgow Wheel@@ ers , said : &quot; In my opinion , he is definitely the best stage rider that Britain has ever produced . &quot; Yet I &apos;m sure if you stopped most people in the street and asked them who Robert Millar is , most Glaswegi@@ ans wouldn &apos;t know . &quot; So we looked at the possibility of setting up a spor@@ tive in Robert &apos;s honour . &quot; He did a lot of his training over the Crow Road , between Len@@ nox@@ town and Fin@@ try , and that is the final climb . &quot; The circuit also goes over the T@@ ak Me Do@@ on from Kil@@ syth , which is tough as well . &quot; Millar &apos;s steely determination and aggressive climbing skills saw him finish fourth in the 1984 Tour de France , as well as securing second places in the Tours of Spain ( twice ) and Italy . And then there were apparent contradic@@ tions : self-de@@ prec@@ ating and shy or self-@@ assured ; pon@@ y-@@ tailed wa@@ if or tough as tea@@ k ; proud of his roots or occasionally dismissive - &quot; the Caledonian anti@@ sy@@ zy@@ gy &quot; on two wheels . Lang put it thus : &quot; Robert was very much a l@@ oner . He was determined to be a world-class cyclist and it didn &apos;t really matter who he upset to get there . &quot; Bil@@ s@@ land , to whom Millar gifted his 1984 King of the Mountains pol@@ ka dot jersey which now hangs on the wall of his bike shop , added : &quot; Robert was special . &quot; He was focused on what he was about . He believed in himself . When he attacked , he attacked to win . &quot; I think he was one of the few Scot@@ smen who ever got their photograph on the front cover of L &apos;@@ Equi@@ pe . &quot; I believe if he had the backing of the Sky team now , he would have won the Tour . Media playback is not supported on this device &quot; When he was with Peugeot , a lot of the French guys didn &apos;t want to ride for him . A lot of the victories he got on his own merit . &quot; The spor@@ tive , Lang believes , is the first time Millar has allowed his name to be used for a cycling event . The intensely private Millar gave his permission to Smith as long as proceeds went to the Glasgow Wheel@@ ers &apos; development squad for young riders and the Bra@@ ve@@ heart Fund , which Smith established a decade ago to improve young Scottish cyclists &apos; prospects . &quot; He was one of my id@@ ols , &quot; said Smith . &quot; He used to come back in the winter to Glasgow . Every year he came round to the house and gave me a jersey . &quot; I was fortunate then ; I was just as small as him so I could use them . &quot; And now , to have a Robert Millar S@@ portive is fantastic because the legacy of the name will go on . &quot; Every hill that you go over will remind you how difficult it was to become King of the Mountains in the biggest annual sporting event in the world . &quot;

S-307	Imran Khawaja tried to sneak back into the UK last year - and while his exact activity in Syria remains a mystery , police say he is one of the most dangerous British jihadists to return from conflict . He was one of the most public British fighters in Syria - always online , but always masked . But now , Imran Khawaja , 27 , from Southall , west London is facing a possible prison term up to life imprisonment for his role in life and death on Syria &apos;s battlefields . Khawaja left the UK last January . He called himself Abu Da@@ ig@@ ham al-@@ Brit@@ ani . And after reaching the war@@ zone via Kurdish territory , he began posting videos and pictures of his personal jihad . In one video he explains how a fellow fighter was shot through the side - but &quot; thanks to Allah &apos;s will &quot; was soon back on the front line . In another - masked again - he is showing off his amateur weigh@@ t-@@ lifting skills as his bro@@ ther@@ s-@@ in-@@ arms cheer him on . Khawaja was a member of Ray@@ at al Ta@@ whe@@ ed - which means Flag of Unity . The group of fighters affiliated to Islamic State includes many British men , and they have spent more than a year selling a message to their supporters and would-be recruits back home . Khawaja was involved in appeals for donations , video diaries of their lives and &quot; through the key@@ hole &quot; tours of fighters &apos; quarters . Shir@@ az Maher , of the International Centre for the Study of Rad@@ ic@@ alisation ( IC@@ SR ) , at Kings College London , has been tracking foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq . He says : &quot; The group that Khawaja was with in Syria was really quite dynamic , &quot; he says . &quot; They clearly had people with programming skills - they were able to put together very slick , well produced propaganda videos and posters that appealed to young British Muslims . &quot; They were able to play on the same cultural anch@@ ors and mo@@ res that those people recognised and know . They could speak to them as peers . &quot; Ray@@ at al Ta@@ whe@@ ed helped a great deal in the early stages of this conflict with portraying the idea of volunteering as a jihadist as quite a glamorous adventurous thing - and a noble thing . &quot; But Ray@@ at &apos;s war was neither noble nor glamorous . Some of its material online showed gruesome scenes of death . One image showed a man &apos;s bloo@@ di@@ ed-@@ hands with the caption &quot; my first time . &quot; And another shocking image included Imran Khawaja . In this gruesome picture , the Londoner - masked yet again - is holding a bag that contains a head . The only thing we know about the victim is that he was supposedly a Syrian army soldier . But we do know that the British security service MI5 was watching - and waiting . And last June , its opportunity came . Imran Khawaja decided to come home . It &apos;s not clear why because he hasn &apos;t told the police . His cousin Tahir Bhatt@@ i , a taxi driver from Watford , agreed to help him return because the family wanted him back safely . Khawaja &apos;s own intentions are unclear . He had originally asked his cousin for money for a new gun - something Bhatt@@ i did not help him with . And then the fighter began trying to cover his tracks . As Bhatt@@ i , who has admitted assisting an offender , drove to Bulgaria to pick him up , Khawaja faked his own death with an online ob@@ ituary that said he had died in battle . The announcement asked that Allah grant him the highest position in heaven . He then tried to slip back into Britain unnoticed . As the pair arrived at Dover , the police were waiting - and they ended up facing prosecution at the Old Bailey . Cdr Richard Walton , the head of the Metropolitan Police &apos;s counter-terrorism command , says : &quot; Imran Khawaja is not a vulnerable teenager who has been enti@@ ced to travel to Syria . &quot; This is a man who chosen the path of terrorism , who has chosen to go out to Syria to be trained and engage in a terrorist training camp . &quot; We don &apos;t know why he came back , we don &apos;t know what he was planning - but we know he concealed his entry and faked his own death . This is a dangerous man . &quot; Imran Khawaja was considered so dangerous that while he was on remand , he was held in the special unit for high risk terrorism suspects at London &apos;s maximum security Bel@@ marsh prison . He has admitted four offences : Tahir Bhatt@@ i has pleaded guilty to assisting an offender . Khawaja had originally faced an additional charge of solic@@ iting to murder . That allegation , the most serious to be made yet against a Syrian fighter , will lie on file .

S-283	She stressed that to kill a police officer was &quot; to attack the fundamental basis of our society . &quot; But Mrs May also said police officers must end &quot; fri@@ vol@@ ous &quot; accident claims and focus on raising public trust . Earlier the Police Federation urged her not to base legislation changes on the behaviour of a &quot; handful of officers . &quot; During her address , Mrs May said suing someone after slipping on their property was &quot; not the sort of attitude &quot; officers should exhibit . Her comments come after it emerged recently that one police officer , PC Kelly Jones , had taken legal action after tri@@ pping on a kerb at a Norfolk petrol station in August . Mrs May also revealed plans to allow police to take over shoplifting prosecutions where goods taken were worth less than Â £ 200 . Un@@ ve@@ iling plans for a change in legislation at the Police Federation conference in Bournemouth , Mrs May announced the government proposal that the minimum term for killing an officer should be increased to life without parole . The current minimum sentence for a police murder is 30 years . By Danny Shaw@@ BBC home affairs correspondent Theresa May &apos;s whole life tariff for police murderers is being welcomed by ran@@ k-and-@@ file officers - but it &apos;s unlikely to quell the anger felt by Police Federation members about the government &apos;s programme of cuts and reforms to the service . High on their list of concerns is an idea , currently the subject of negotiation , which would allow chief constables to make police compul@@ sor@@ ily redundant . Officers say chiefs could get rid of officers they don &apos;t like or those approaching pension age - and with no industrial rights there &apos;d be nothing police could do about it . A final decision on whether the home secretary will go ahead is expected in the summer . The federation would no doubt toast Mrs May if she abandoned the whole idea . The home secretary told ran@@ k-and-@@ file officers the murder of a police officer was &quot; a particularly appalling crime . &quot; &quot; We ask police officers to keep us safe by confronting and stopping violent criminals for us , &quot; she said . &quot; And sometimes you are targeted by criminals because of what you represent . &quot; She added : &quot; We are clear - life should mean life for anyone convicted of killing a police officer . &quot; The Criminal Justice Act 2003 permits Justice Secretary Chris Grayling - following consultation with the Sentencing Council - to make an order to change starting points for sentences . In this instance , it enables him to change the starting point from 30 years to a whole life order , meaning offenders could not be released other than at the discretion of the secretary of state on compassionate grounds - for example , if they are terminally ill or seriously incapac@@ itated . The Sentencing Council , the official body that oversees sentencing in England and Wales , issues guidelines for judges and magistrates to work to for all offences other than murder . A spokesman said : &quot; Introducing whole life tariffs for those who murder police officers would involve changes to the law , which is a matter for Parliament , rather than the Sentencing Council . &quot; But he confirmed that the government had a duty to consult with the council before new legislation could be brought in . The Sentencing Council says that , as things stand , whole life orders can be imposed in murder cases &quot; if the court decides that the offence is so serious that the offender should spend the rest of their life in prison . &quot; There are currently 47 prisoners in England and Wales who have been given whole life tariffs , including Rosemary West and &quot; Yorkshire Ri@@ pper &quot; Peter Sutcliffe . The home secretary , who faced a question and answer session after her speech , was heckled at last year &apos;s conference after she told officers to &quot; stop pretending &quot; they were being singled out and would &quot; have to make their share &quot; of public spending cuts . Police Federation chairman Steve Williams , who had earlier welcomed Mrs May &apos;s sentencing plan , told her morale was low as a result of the government &apos;s programme of cuts and reforms . Speaking at the conference , he urged the home secretary not to &quot; hang your reforms on the reprehensible behaviour of a handful of officers . &quot; The biggest applause came when he called for the government to abandon plans for compulsory severance , which are currently subject to negotiation . Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Win@@ sor , who is behind hotly debated changes such as fast-track recruitment and lower annual pay for new constables , was also due to address officers . On Tuesday , shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told the three-day conference that government plans to withdraw from the European Arrest Warrant agreement would make it harder to catch criminals who went on the run abroad .

S-14	The claims against the agricultural commodities trader were made in a report by Mighty , a US-based environmental lobby group . Mighty also accuses O@@ lam and its main stake@@ holder , Singapore state-owned investment company Tem@@ as@@ ek , of turning a blind eye to these practices . Both companies reject the allegations . Singapore and Malaysia regularly suffer from haze caused by sl@@ ash@@ -and-@@ burn practices by small-scale farmers and rogue palm oil traders in Indonesia . Indonesia is often blamed for not doing enough to tackle the agriculture fires used to clear vegetation for palm oil , pul@@ p and paper plantations in the Ri@@ au province in East Sum@@ atra , South Sum@@ atra , and parts of Kal@@ im@@ ant@@ an on Indonesian Borneo . Singapore@@ -based O@@ lam has confirmed that it buys 99 % of its palm oil from third party suppliers and while it is a relative newcomer to the industry , it says it accounts for less than 1 % of the global market . Mighty &apos;s report says O@@ lam and Tem@@ ask could be unwittingly encouraging unsustainable palm oil trading practices that may contribute to the haze that is caused by the fires . It also says O@@ lam created a &quot; secretive market for rogue palm oil companies &quot; that allowed the vast majority of its product to be bought from unknown sources . But O@@ lam chief executive Sunny Ver@@ gh@@ ese told the BBC that the firm had a &quot; very vigorous sourcing policy and we insist that there is zero tolerance for burning , so it &apos;s a &apos; no bur@@ n-@@ no pe@@ at-@@ no deforestation &apos; compliance policy . &quot; The company only agreed to release the names of its 14 suppliers on Monday , having previously resisted calls by Mighty to do so . Mr Ver@@ gh@@ ese said he believed the firm &apos;s current suppliers all met O@@ lam &apos;s strict requirements , but added that the vetting and verification process would take several more years to complete . He added that producers who do not comply with the company &apos;s sustainable principles would be removed from its supply chain . Since Tem@@ as@@ ek is the majority stake holder in O@@ lam , Mighty &apos;s allegations could link Singapore &apos;s state fund to the devastating annual haze affecting Singapore , Thailand , Malaysia and Indonesia - if the claims of sourcing from rogue palm oil producers are proven . Tem@@ as@@ ek &apos;s investment in O@@ lam means that &quot; the people of Singapore have unwittingly financed what is likely one of the world &apos;s black boxes for the kind of un@@ sustainably produced palm oil that fuels the haze , &quot; the report says . Tem@@ as@@ ek has dismissed the allegations , explaining that they &quot; fully support no-@@ burn policies for land clearance , and would urge oil palm companies and plantation owners to do the same . &quot; The fund told the BBC : &quot; O@@ lam &apos;s operations are properly matters for the board and management of O@@ lam to address . &quot; As a matter of proper governance , Tem@@ as@@ ek does not direct the business operations of our portfolio companies , including O@@ lam . &quot; It would be fair to say that the palm oil industry globally has a troubled track record . It is one of the world &apos;s biggest industries , projected to be worth $ 8@@ 8bn by 2022 but also often accused of unfair and illegal labour practices , as well as deforestation and the burning of plantations . Green groups and palm oil executives often find themselves at loggerheads with one another - NGOs say that the industry is wilfully turning a blind eye to environmentally un@@ friendly practices , while palm oil executives claim it is an industry-@@ wide problem , and policing third party suppliers is impossible . Activists say governments need to punish palm oil firms that don &apos;t comply with acceptable standards of protecting the environment - but changing the government mindset can be challenging , because the reality is many of these firms bring jobs and investment to rural areas . The report also highlights concerns in the African state of Gabon , where according to Mighty , O@@ lam &quot; bulldo@@ zes rain@@ forests to establish mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ ture palm oil plantations , &quot; bringing the same practices to Africa &quot; that have destroyed vast natural landscapes in Southeast Asia . &quot; In response to the accusation that O@@ lam is responsible for vast forest clear@@ ings through its joint ventures with the government of Gabon , O@@ lam said its privat@@ e-@@ public partnerships in the country stro@@ ve to be both responsible and transparent . &quot; We agree with Gabon &apos;s sovereign right to convert a tiny percentage of its least valuable forested land for agriculture , so long as it is responsibly and transparen@@ tly done , &quot; it said . &quot; Our plans and progress for developing sustainable palm oil plantations have been shared transparen@@ tly with stakeholders and put in the public domain . &quot;

S-198	Media playback is not supported on this device World champion Hamilton started from the back , suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops . The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-@@ point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season . Ferrari &apos;s Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap . The incident damaged both cars , with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo . Raikkonen &apos;s rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages , Ferrari &apos;s decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the medi@@ ums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa . Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg &apos;s points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship . The race was shaped by an incid@@ ent-@@ packed opening , with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four . By that stage , Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-@@ corner collisions . Raikkonen moved right into Vettel &apos;s path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat . Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber &apos;s Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen &apos;s damaged car swerving back on to the circuit . Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-@@ podium room after the race , saying : &quot; If I don &apos;t go left , you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo . &quot; Kvyat replied : &quot; We didn &apos;t crash . &quot; Vettel responded : &quot; You didn &apos;t . You were lucky this time . &quot; Kvyat shrugged : &quot; I &apos;m on the podium ; you &apos;re on the podium . &quot; In the post-@@ race interviews , Kvyat added : &quot; You see the gap , you go for it on the inside . You see one car it is hard to see both . It was a risky move , I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium . &quot; Listen to Vettel &apos;s post-@@ race rant At the front , Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pol@@ e-@@ sitter Rosberg at the first corner . In the process his left-@@ rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg &apos;s front wing . Whether it was that or the debris on the track , Ricciardo suffered a left-@@ rear puncture on lap three , allowing the Mercedes to pass . Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case , but his removal from the lead left the German ser@@ ene out front . Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-@@ started on lap nine , Rosberg simply drove off into the distance . Listen to the first-@@ lap madness Hamilton , meanwhile , was in the wars . Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car , doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the sof@@ ts for the rest of the race . So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart . He began his fightback from there , with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton , who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr . &quot; The car was pretty damaged , &quot; said the 31-year-old afterwards . &quot; I &apos;m sure it was some a@@ ero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flex@@ ing all over the place . &quot; Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a &quot; lot of aerodynamic performance . &quot; After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race , Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year .

S-253	Muk@@ her@@ jee &apos;s The Lives Of Others , a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta , is 5 / 2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill . It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English , regardless of nationality . The winner will be announced at London &apos;s Guildhall on Tuesday night . Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers , two Americans and an Australian on this year &apos;s shortlist . Also on the list are Ali Smith , Joshua Ferris , Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan , who is next in the betting at 3 / 1 . Jacobson , who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Fin@@ kler Question , is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who in@@ habit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion , referred to as &quot; What Hap@@ pened , If It Hap@@ pened . &quot; Muk@@ her@@ jee &apos;s The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967 , and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism . Inver@@ ness@@ -born Smith &apos;s How To Be Both tells two inter@@ linking stories , one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy , the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first . She has been shortlisted twice before , with 2005 &apos;s The Acc@@ id@@ ental and Hotel World in 2001 . American Ferris &apos;s third novel , To Rise Again at a Dec@@ ent Hour , looks at athe@@ ism through the eyes of a New York dentist , who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name . The other American is Fowler , who is nominated for We Are All Compl@@ et@@ ely B@@ eside Our@@ selves . The book , narr@@ ated by a college student Rosemary , tells the story of her family : two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special . Australia &apos;s Flanagan is the only non-@@ British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist . He is nominated for The Nar@@ row Road to the Deep North , a love story set against the construction of the Tha@@ il@@ and-@@ Burma Death Railway in World War Two . Of all the shortlisted novels , Fowler &apos;s We Are All Compl@@ et@@ ely B@@ eside Our@@ selves is by far the best-selling . Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies , according to figures from Nielsen . The next closest is Ferris &apos;s To Rise Again at a Dec@@ ent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May . The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist . Muk@@ her@@ jee &apos;s The Lives of Others , which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 50@@ 7 a week later . &quot; It &apos;s a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut , &quot; said David Bra@@ un@@ er , professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading . &quot; The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson &apos;s J , but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Man@@ tel &apos;s double win ( with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies ) . &quot; John Sutherland &apos;s mischievous ( or perhaps malicious ) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Un@@ fin@@ ishable Nov@@ els in The Guardian last week won &apos;t have helped its chances either . &quot; It revi@@ ves the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rim@@ ington called &apos; read@@ able &apos; books . &quot; This year marks is 4@@ 6th year of the Booker Prize . The judging panel , chaired by AC Grayling , consists of Sarah Chur@@ ch@@ well , Jonathan Bate , Daniel Glas@@ er , Alastair Ni@@ ven and Er@@ ica Wagner . Last year , the Booker was won by New Zealand &apos;s Eleanor C@@ atton for The L@@ umin@@ aries . At 28 , she was the young@@ est-ever winner . The shortlisted authors each receive £ 2,500 and a specially bound edition of their book . Cover@@ age from this year &apos;s ceremony , where the prize will be presented by the Duchess of Corn@@ wall@@ . will be on the BBC News Channel from 2@@ 130 BST and on BBC Arts .

S-373	Media playback is not supported on this device The 23-year-old earned GB &apos;s second medal of the Hong Kong championships following Elinor Barker &apos;s silver medal in the women &apos;s scratch on Wednesday . Latham emerged from the pack to take bronze as he chased down Adrian Te@@ k@@ lin@@ ski of Poland , who won gold , and Luc@@ ass L@@ iss of Germany , who got silver . In the men &apos;s team pursuit , GB were beaten to the bronze medal by Italy . Media playback is not supported on this device &quot; I am really happy to come away with a medal , finally , &quot; Latham told the BBC . &quot; I wasn &apos;t sure that Te@@ k@@ lin@@ ski was going to hold on there . &quot; I was in a decent position most of the time . I followed the Irish rider Felix English and I had a good lead out . &quot; Elsewhere Britain &apos;s sole rider in the men &apos;s keirin , Joe Truman , was outclassed in his semi-final , having tried to take the race out with two laps to go . And in the women &apos;s team pursuit , GB finished fifth in the heats and failed to make the bron@@ ze-@@ medal ride . Olympic gold medallist Chris Boardman &quot; Latham had a fantastic final charge . He timed his effort well there . &quot; We hardly saw him in the race , he monitored things but that &apos;s why . He was waiting for that final sprint . And what a ride that was for him . &quot; But with three laps to go , I would not have said that Te@@ k@@ lin@@ ski would make it , but he found something from somewhere to just hang on there . &quot; More than 2km out , he effectively started to sprint . It will take him some time to recover from that . &quot; Six@@ -time Olympic gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy &quot; I don &apos;t think that would be expected . It &apos;s the kind of event you can never be super-@@ confident of winning or winning a medal in . &quot; But if you ride sensibly , which he did , he positioned himself very well and didn &apos;t waste any energy in the first part of the race . &quot; He marked the danger men and clearly had the legs for the sprint at the end . That &apos;s fantastic , a really great result for him and the team . &quot; Team pursuit Olympic gold medallist Elinor Barker came into the quartet of Emily Nelson , Man@@ on Lloyd and Ellie Dickinson . The young squad were unable to compete for a medal but Barker remained positive about their progress . She told the BBC : &quot; It &apos;s the first Worlds for all of these girls and it &apos;s made it a lot more exciting . &quot; The level is so high already physically and technically . We have so much scope for improvement . It &apos;s such a good place to be in . &quot; Four years until Tokyo and we &apos;ve just come fifth at the Worlds . &quot; Double Olympic gold medallist Joanna Row@@ sell Shand said on BBC TV : &quot; Coming into the competition , I don &apos;t think anyone expected them to medal . &quot; Until Elinor Barker joined the team today , we had four brand new riders . With an average age of 19 , they &apos;ve all got bright futures ahead of them . &quot; Earlier in the day , Olympic bronze medallist Katy Marchant was eliminated from the women &apos;s sprint in the first round . The 24-year-old , who claimed bronze behind Kristina Vog@@ el of Germany and fellow Briton Becky James at Rio 2016 , was the only female sprinter to travel to Hong Kong . The former heptath@@ le@@ te qualified in 16th place but was ousted by 17@@ th-@@ fastest Lin Jun@@ h@@ ong of China earlier on Thursday . Marchant is scheduled to compete in two more events - Saturday &apos;s 500m time-@@ trial and Sunday &apos;s keirin . &quot; I &apos;m really disappointed . I feel like I &apos;m just missing a little bit of zing , which is something that coming off Rio is to be expected , &quot; she said . &quot; I didn &apos;t get the roar when I got the number on my back today - maybe the fact it &apos;s not an Olympic Games or something in the back of my mind telling me that I &apos;m not feeling great . &quot; I know to get knocked out in the first round is not what we expect from a medallist , but the preparation coming into this competition is about the process leading on to Tokyo . &quot; Media playback is not supported on this device

S-401	Compared with other European countries , many apprenticeships are low quality and too short , the Sutton Trust warns . It says thousands of apprenticeships should be created to boost the economy and improve youngsters &apos; job prospects . The Department for Education says apprenticeships are being reformed to &quot; drive up standards . &quot; The Association of Colleges said some existing apprenticeships were respected by industry and should be preserved . The study , which was carried out by the Boston Consulting Group on behalf of the Sutton Trust , says fewer than 200,000 of the 5@@ 20,000 apprenticeships starting in England every year are rated at level three - which is equivalent to A-level . The report cites figures that suggest apprenticeships are offered by just one in five ( 20 % ) of employers in England , compared with over half ( 51 % ) in Germany , which , the report says , is considered to have one of the best vocational education systems . Only 6@@ 1,000 new apprenticeship starts were for young people , whereas in Germany , 5@@ 70,000 new apprenticeships are for youngsters and 90 % of these are equivalent to A-levels . The report also notes that England &apos;s vocational system has 18,000 different qualifications , while Germany has 330 . The report warns that since 2010 , more than half ( 58 % ) of apprenticeships have been below level three and three-quarters have been aimed at those over the age of 25 , many of whom are already in work . And it warns 11 young people are competing for each apprenticeship . In his fore@@ word to the report , Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lamp@@ l said the report had found that , with some exceptions , the opportunities on offer to young people who did not go to university were &quot; poor . &quot; The attitude in England , with some exceptions , was very different to that in countries such as Germany and Switzerland , he said . &quot; Instead of a clear system of respected vocational routes , we suffer from a complicated patchwork where too many young people are offered qualifications of little worth in a system that conf@@ uses employers and is not valued as it should be by society , &quot; he said . He said the &quot; cruel deception &quot; about an expansion in apprenticeships , when many were below level three and the majority went to older workers , had to stop . The report calls for apprenticeships to be radically expanded , with up to 300,000 new starts each year . The majority of these should be at level three at least for three years , with some four-year courses at level four - higher than A-levels . No more than 10 % of apprenticeships should be two-year courses at level two , it says . Sir Peter said : &quot; Real apprenticeships are as important to social mobility as good university degrees . &quot; Students facing huge loans for a university education find themselves between a rock and a hard place . Even if they would prefer to work with training , the lack of good apprenticeships means they feel they have little choice . &quot; England &apos;s patchwork vocational system not only hin@@ ders our economic competitiveness , it prevents tens of thousands of young people from gaining good skilled jobs . &quot; Teresa Fr@@ ith , from the Association of Colleges , said : &quot; Creating 300,000 apprenticeships , when the report acknowledges there is already a shortage of apprenticeship places for 16 to-@@ year-olds , would be a massive challenge and although we agree that there is a business case for employers to take on apprentices , at the moment too few do . &quot; The report also says level three apprenticeships should be the priority . This isn &apos;t a bad idea in principle but some level two apprenticeships , such as those in construction , are well-@@ respected by the industry and should be preserved . &quot; The report is absolutely right to say that vocational courses should only be taught in institutions with high-quality facilities and expert teaching staff and that careers advice and guidance needs to be improved . &quot; A Department for Education spokeswoman said : &quot; We are already radically reforming apprenticeships to drive up standards so that they are more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers . &quot; Since 2010 over a million people have become apprentices , providing a great start to their careers . We have already insisted that apprenticeships last for a minimum of a year , include more English and maths and that every apprenticeship is a job . &quot; We have consulted on wider reforms to drive up standards in apprenticeships further , and will publish plans later this month . &quot;

S-156	French firm EDF , which is financing most of the £ 18bn Hinkley Point project in Somerset , approved the funding at a board meeting . Con@@ tracts were to be signed on Friday . But Business Secretary Greg Clark has said the government will &quot; consider carefully &quot; before backing it . EDF chief executive Vincent de Riv@@ az has cancelled a trip to Hinkley Point on Friday following Mr Clark &apos;s comments . Critics of the plan have warned of environmental damage and potential escalating costs . They are also concerned that the plant is being built by foreign governments . One third of the £ 18bn cost is being provided by Chinese investors . Hours after EDF &apos;s board voted to approve the £ 18bn power plant on Thursday , the government launched a further review of the project . This stunning new development came all the way from the top of government and the timing seemed calculated to cause maximum impact . EDF executives were taken completely off guard , the post-Brexit run of major investment is abruptly halted and what precious ent@@ ente cor@@ di@@ ale in Anglo-@@ French relations there is left after the EU referendum result seems diminished . Is it a genuine pause for a new government to read the small print of a project that is two administrations old , or a signal of a potential change in policy ? Simon Jack : Hinkley delay is a high stakes bet Tom Great@@ rex , the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association , urged the government to make a decision as soon as possible . &quot; We need to get on and do this and that &apos;s why I &apos;m hoping the government make their decision very soon because if it goes on for a lengthy period of time we are going to run the risk of having real problems in terms of our energy supplies , &quot; he said . &quot; Then what happens is that we end up paying a lot more and we end up paying for much more dirty power which we can &apos;t afford to do if we are to meet our climate commitments . &quot; Claire Jacobson , head of climate , energy and environment policy at the EEF manufacturers &apos; organisation said the government &apos;s decision was &quot; yet another blow to a decision that has been hindered by many delays and uncertainties . &quot; Hinkley Point C is expected to provide 7 % of the UK &apos;s total electricity requirement . Announcing the approval of investment on Thursday , EDF had described the plant as &quot; a unique asset for French and British industries , &quot; saying it would benefit the nuclear sectors in both countries and would give a boost to employment . However , the project has been hit in recent months by concerns about EDF &apos;s financial capacity . Despite the Chinese investment , Hinkley Point would remain an enormous undertaking for the stressed French company , which has had to raise money from its owners . Earlier this week , EDF shareholders approved plans to issue new shares to raise € 4bn ( £ 3.4bn ) to help pay for the project . Ahead of Thursday &apos;s vote on whether to approve the project , an EDF board member , Gerard Magn@@ in , resigned , saying the project was &quot; very risky &quot; financially . Earlier this year , EDF &apos;s finance director , Thomas Piqu@@ em@@ al , had resigned amid reports he thought Hinkley could damage EDF itself . 5,@@ 600 workers on site at peak 4@@ ,000km electrical cab@@ ling 230,000 tonnes of steel 5.6m cubic metres of earth to be moved Environmentalists are also concerned about the plan . Greenpeace executive director John Sau@@ ven said : &quot; Coun@@ tless experts have warned that for British families this power station will be terrible value for money . He added that EDF &apos;s decision to go ahead with the investment , &quot; doesn &apos;t prove the UK is open for business post-Brexit - it just shows the Hinkley deal became too big to fail in the eyes of British and French politicians . &quot; The campaign group added that more investment was needed for renewable energy such as offshore wind . Jan 2006 - Government proposes nuclear as part of future energy mix Mar 2013 - Construction of Hinkley Point approved Oct 2013 - UK government agrees £ 9@@ 2.50 per megaw@@ att@@ -hour will be paid for electricity produced at the Somerset site - around double the current market rate at the time Oct 2015 - EDF signs investment agreement with China General Nuclear Power Corporation ( CG@@ N ) July 2016 - EDF board approves final investment decision , but the UK Government postp@@ ones a final decision on the project until autumn .

S-486	Media playback is not supported on this device Eigh@@ th-@@ tier Taunton were playing their ninth game in this season &apos;s competition and were the lowest-@@ ranked side left after West@@ fields &apos; exit on Monday .

But the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Sear@@ le , and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012 / 13 . Taunton frustrated the hosts in the first half , with Barrow defenders Nick Ander@@ ton and Danny Li@@ ves@@ ey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession . Williams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over . But Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right-footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards . Palmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner . But Barrow soon restored their lead and keeper Lloyd Irish prevented Ross Hannah , Richie Bennett and Williams making the victory more emphatic .

S-466	Inv@@ esting Solutions received those benefit payments over the past two years by finding properties for single homeless men . The charity , Fresh Start Housing , finds clients from London homeless charities . Neither the charity nor the company act illegally , but a homeless group says the relationship is &quot; a new low . &quot; Inv@@ esting Solutions said &quot; the bulk &quot; of their rents get passed to private landlords , while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Inv@@ esting Solutions and private landlords . The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person , rather than the property . Therefore , the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property &apos;s landlord . Both Inv@@ esting Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building , a storage unit in south London . Records held at Companies House show Inv@@ esting Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel , who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010 . The documents say the charity would help &quot; the needs of current and ex-@@ offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty , sickness and distress . &quot; Operating across seven London boroughs , Inv@@ esting Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK , making the venture hugely profitable . In one property we visited , Inv@@ esting Solutions was claiming £ 2,@@ 114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants . The owner of the house was getting £ 1,@@ 150 per month , giving the agency an annual gross profit of £ 1@@ 1,5@@ 68 on the one property . The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35 , saying that is because this is the group facing &quot; the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation . &quot; But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation . In the boroughs in which Inv@@ esting Solutions operates , that means they can charge up to £ 260 per week for each private room . One of the tenants , Nigel McCann , was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing . They passed him to Inv@@ esting Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water , rats and damp . He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable . Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Inv@@ esting Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014 . &quot; It &apos;s all about the money , it &apos;s not about the people , &quot; he added . &quot; I thought inspections would be made . &quot; Nearly half the money that Inv@@ esting Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London , which has paid the lett@@ ings agency more than £ 2.@@ 1m. The council said it has a &quot; dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe , secure and affordable . &quot; Matt Downie , of homeless charity Crisis , said : &quot; We &apos;ve heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice . But this idea of having a charity t@@ acked on to poor practice is a new low . &quot; Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees . He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords &quot; who , to make exce@@ ed@@ ingly clear , own the properties . The simple point being , the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients . &quot; He also said his company was &quot; genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client &apos;s property . &quot; Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 7@@ 88 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months , including re-@@ housed tenants . It also said it did not have &quot; authority from the relevant parties &quot; to reveal how many were housed with Inv@@ esting Solutions . A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for &quot; rigorously safe@@ -@@ guarding taxpayers &apos; money , with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing . &quot;

S-176	&quot; I &apos;m feeling the joints for any kind of heat or swelling . &quot; Veterinary surgeon Dr Sandra Corr puts Daisy the sheep through a very hands-on physical examination . &quot; I &apos;m looking for any signs of cre@@ pit@@ us or lam@@ eness , &quot; she says , &quot; Anything that might indicate the onset of disease or oste@@ o@@ arthritis . &quot; But Daisy is not just any sheep . She &apos;s a cl@@ one . One of a flock of 13 cl@@ oned sheep currently living out their lives on a farm owned by the University of Nottingham , and one of only four ( the others are Debbie , Denise and Diane ) cl@@ oned from the same adult e@@ we as Dolly the sheep - the first cl@@ oned mammal born in 1996 . This , despite the passage of a couple of generations in shee@@ p-@@ years , says Kevin Sinclair , professor of developmental biology at Nottingham and lead author on the study , makes them Dolly &apos;s - and that original e@@ we &apos;s - identical twin sisters . &quot; Where there was one Dolly , with these four girls , now there are five , &quot; he says . We &apos;re standing in a straw@@ -@@ lined pen in a barn on the university &apos;s Sutton Bon@@ ington Campus and one-@@ by-@@ one all 13 sheep are put through the same set of ex@@ acting , method@@ ical tests . As far as I can tell it &apos;s a process the sheep seem well used to . If not exactly enthusiastic , they sto@@ ically endure the joint manip@@ ulations with something approaching world weary resignation . But if the sheep seem un@@ fazed by all the attention , that may be because they are among the most closely monitored and studied animals anywhere in the world . According to Prof Sinclair , the fate of the whole science of cl@@ oning may hang on the results . He tells me : &quot; One of the big questions that surrounded the creation of Dolly , and all the cl@@ oning work that has gone on since , is : do these animals age in a normal way and how healthy are they ? &quot; Under@@ pinning this question is a fundamental concern about the cl@@ oning process . Because it involves extracting DNA from the cell of an adult animal - a cell that is fully differenti@@ ated and has been through multiple cell divisions - some &quot; age-@@ memory &quot; might be transferred into the next generation . &quot; That would mean that the cl@@ oned animal was somehow much older that you might expect , &quot; says Prof Sinclair . &quot; A new born cl@@ one might look like a lamb , but in terms of cell@@ ular sen@@ es@@ cence it would be much older , and the animal would start to develop diseases associated with aging at a much younger age . &quot; The original Dolly died at the relatively modest age for a sheep of six-@@ and-a-half . Along with several other members of her flock she had contracted a virus that caused les@@ ions to develop in her lungs and she had to be put down . But by then Dolly was already suffering from oste@@ o@@ arthritis which , although not unheard of in a sheep of her age , did raise concerns about premature aging . The decision was taken to go back to the original cell line and to produce more cl@@ ones . &quot; We wanted to know if Dolly &apos;s untimely death was just unlucky , &quot; recalled Prof Sinclair , &quot; or if it was something to do with the cl@@ oning process itself . If illnesses like arthritis that are associated with old age were more common in cl@@ oned animals . &quot; Getting the answers to those questions has involved putting the dol@@ lies , and nine other sheep cl@@ oned from different cell lines , through an exhaustive battery of tests and assessments including regular joint X-rays and a series of full-@@ body f@@ MRI scans . Prof Sinclair said : &quot; We focused on three co-@@ mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ties : cardiovascular disease , diabetes and oste@@ o@@ arthritis - the three co-@@ mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ties most associated with aging . Were these animals any different from the wider population of sheep with regard to these particular co-@@ mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ties . &quot; The results of the study , which could have profound implications for the future of cl@@ oning , will be published next week . But for now , the dol@@ lies , which are approaching their ninth and tenth birthdays , seem to be in rude health . Follow Tom on Twitter .

S-411	It follows suggestions third-party software had been used to steal intimate photos of celebrities - posted online last month - from i@@ Cloud . The action should stop the tool from being able to infiltrate Apple &apos;s internet storage service if the safety measure is implemented . However , the security facility remains an opt-@@ in choice . One expert suggested that Apple should instead make it the default option . The process works by introducing an extra step after an account holder has typed their user@@ name and password into a device they have not used before . They are also required to enter a four-@@ digit code that is either texted to a trusted mobile phone number or sent via Apple &apos;s Find My iPhone app . If the person does not enter the code , they are refused access to i@@ Cloud and are blocked from making an iTunes , i@@ Books , or App Store purchase . They can , however , use a 14-@@ character recovery key to regain access to the account in the event their trusted device is lost or stolen . They are told to keep this in a safe place to avoid being locked out . While Apple had offered the two-@@ step verification system in the past , until now it had not come into play when device owners used the firm &apos;s back-up service . That meant that even if people had switched on the two-@@ step feature to prevent cyber-@@ thieves logging into their accounts with a stolen or guessed password , the attackers could still download a complete back-up of their data by using El@@ com@@ soft &apos;s Phone Pass@@ word Bre@@ aker . Several hackers &apos; forums contain discussions about using of pirated copies of El@@ com@@ soft &apos;s &quot; forensic &quot; software , which is marketed as a tool for law enforcement agencies to access i@@ Cloud content without needing to be in possession of a suspect &apos;s iPhone or iPad . Elm@@ com@@ Soft &apos;s Mos@@ cow@@ -based owner told the BBC earlier this month that he believed his software had been used in the recent hacks , as it was &quot; the only one able to do that . &quot; He has now acknowledged that Apple &apos;s changes guard against the technique he had used . &quot; I think that implementation is secure , and so there is no work@@ around , &quot; Vladimir Kat@@ al@@ ov told the BBC , adding that his program could no longer even get a list of devices and back-@@ ups linked to a user &apos;s account . &quot; The other security improvement , which I like , is that now the owner of the Apple account gets a notification by email immediately when a back-up starts downloading - whether or not two-@@ factor authentication is enabled . &quot; However , he added that he still had concerns about Apple &apos;s security system . &quot; The recovery key is hard to remember . And as far as you are not going to use it frequently - it is not needed at all while you have the trusted device handy - there is a good chance that you lose it , &quot; he said . &quot; And if you lose your device too , there will be no way to get your data back . &quot; Secondly , the recovery key might be stolen . And someone who managed to get your Apple ID password and your security key could make a lot of trouble for you , not just downloading your selfies . &quot; But another security expert downplayed the risk of lost recovery keys , and said that Apple should do more than just recommend people switch on the two-@@ factor test . &quot; We &apos;ve seen so much in recent times that single-@@ step verification - ie passwords - is vulnerable , we &apos;re at the stage that two-@@ factor authentication should be the default , &quot; said Prof Alan Woodward , from the University of Surrey . &quot; It &apos;s a case of turn it on by default , and let people turn it off if they really don &apos;t want it . &quot; And that applies to not just Apple , but companies like Microsoft and Google too . &quot; Apple has told the Wall Street Journal that it &quot; plans to more aggressively encourage people &quot; to turn two-@@ factor authentication on and use stronger passwords . &quot; When I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done , I think about the awareness piece , &quot; chief executive Tim Cook told the newspaper . &quot; I think we have a responsibility to rat@@ chet that up . That &apos;s not really an engineering thing . &quot;

S-446	The Bulls &apos; fate has been in the balance since the full extent of their financial worries emerged in the weeks since their dramatic final-day escape sent Chester down instead . Chester have been reinstated as a Conference Premier club and Hayes &amp; Y@@ ea@@ ding will stay in Conference South . &quot; Hereford United can have no complaints . The Conference bent over backwards to help them . &quot; I described the news of the board &apos;s offer of an extension on Friday evening as not so much &apos; last chance saloon &apos; , but rather &apos; last orders in last chance saloon &apos; and United have seemingly chosen not to offer the league the assurances they were seeking . &quot; It is a desperately sad day for all Hereford supporters , but the Bulls have nobody to blame but themselves . &quot; You have to feel very sorry for those players who gave their all at Aldershot on the last day of the season to keep Hereford in the Conference Premier . Sadly , those efforts now count for nothing . &quot; The Conference had originally offered a payment deadline of Thursday , 5 June . The club &apos;s debt to their football creditors , including former boss Martin Foyle , members of the current squad , other club staff and clubs from whom the Bulls loaned players during the 2013-14 season , added up to £ 14@@ 8,000 . That deadline was extended three times , to Friday , 6 June , then again to Saturday , 7 June and for a third time until Thursday , 12 June . But it became clear on Tuesday that the Bulls , taken over last week by London businessman Tommy Ag@@ om@@ bar , would not make that deadline - and the Conference has now acted . The last team to be expelled from the Conference was Chester City in February 2010 . They reformed as Chester FC two months later - and it is now they who have taken the Bulls &apos; place , following a dramatic final day of the season when , almost simultaneously , a late Hereford winning goal at Aldershot and a Salisbury equaliser at Chester kept the Bulls up . By way of an added twist , Chester announced on Tuesday that Kingsley James , who was in Hereford &apos;s team that day , has moved to Bum@@ pers Lane . 26 April - Hereford stay up on final day of Conference Premier season 29 April - Hereford United Supporters &apos; Trust make offer to buy the club for £ 1 and clear their £ 220,000 debts 22 May - Former Bulls boss Martin Foyle serves winding-up petition over unpaid wages , after players reveal they have not been fully paid too 2 June - Case adjourned for 28 days at Royal Court of Justice 3 June - Tommy Ag@@ om@@ bar takes over as new Hereford owner 5 June - Hereford fail to meet 17 : 00 BST deadline to pay football creditors , and are threatened with expulsion , subject to Conference board vote 6 June - Hereford meet with Conference board and are given new deadline of 7 June . The deadline is moved to 9 June , then 12 June 10 June - Hereford expelled from Football Conference And former Hereford boss Foyle , now manager at Southport , chose the same day to sign another player from that same Bulls team , keeper Dan Lloyd-@@ Weston , who opted to leave as he was still owed part of his salary . When last season ended , despite months of fundraising efforts by fans , as well as generous donations from fans of other clubs , the Bulls faced debts of approximately £ 2@@ 25,000 . They still owe over £ 70,000 to clear the latest PA@@ Y@@ E tax demand from HM Revenue and Customs ( HMRC ) . An offer was made by one of the club &apos;s main fan bodies , the Hereford United Supporters &apos; Trust ( H@@ US@@ T ) , on the back of pledges made by their backers , to buy the club for £ 1 and take over the running at Edgar Street . But , although chairman David Key@@ te held talks with them , they were not the preferred option . Key@@ te was reported to have been in talks with three different rival bidders before Ag@@ om@@ bar &apos;s takeover . The downward spiral of Hereford &apos;s financial situation since being relegated from the Football League in May 2012 has been exacerbated by falling gates . The average attendance for the 2013-14 season at Edgar Street was 1,7@@ 58 , little over half the average gate they attracted of 3,@@ 270 in League Two just five years ago .

I take my responsibilities very seriously . But it &apos;s about finding your own way at the right time and if you &apos;re not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you &apos;ve got to develop into the duty role , &quot; he said . He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties , but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so . &apos; I don &apos;t lie awake waiting to be king &apos; - full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a &quot; work shy &quot; prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who , up until now , have rarely criticised him . In the BBC &apos;s interview , it was interesting to see his response . He accepts that he will be criticised &quot; but it &apos;s not something I take completely to heart . &quot; An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won &apos;t necessarily influence his decisions . It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible , both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself . There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be . When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was &quot; the best role model I could have in front of me . &quot; Full details of Queen &apos;s birthday celebrations Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen &apos;s birthday , including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family . The picture of the Queen , Prince Charles , Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year . Six further stamps have been released for the head of state &apos;s 90th birthday , three focusing on the Queen &apos;s family life and three honouring her official role . On her actual birthday , on Thursday , the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen &apos;s Walk@@ way , a 6.@@ 3km self-@@ guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance . It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-@@ great-@@ grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months . In the evening , she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday . On Friday , US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle . Britain &apos;s longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year , her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June . Republic said the Queen &apos;s birthday &quot; does not warrant this kind of coverage &quot; and that the BBC had a &quot; duty to report , not to celebrate the royals . &quot; Graham Smith , the republican pressure group &apos;s CEO , added that the BBC had &quot; failed completely &quot; to report the birthday in a way that was &quot; fair , balanced and proportionate . &quot;

S-478	The Labour leader has also said he is &quot; very angry &quot; that so many lives were lost in a deadly tower block fire . PM Theresa May said the residents were &quot; in our thoughts and prayers &quot; and has ordered a public inquiry into the fire . But she was criticised by a senior Labour MP for failing to meet residents when she visited the scene on Thursday . At least 17 people died in the disaster at Grenfell Tower in North Kensington , west London in the early hours of Wednesday . Mr Corbyn , who earlier released a statement saying he was &quot; very angry that it was possible for the fire to spread in the way it did , &quot; said people living in high-rise flats would be frightened following the Grenfell Tower disaster and needed answers to give them &quot; peace of mind . &quot; And he told MPs on Thursday : &quot; The south part of Kensington is incredibly wealthy , it &apos;s the wealthiest part of the country . &quot; The ward where this fire took place is , I think the poorest ward in the whole country . &quot; And properties must be found , requ@@ is@@ iti@@ oned if necessary , in order to make sure those residents do get re-@@ housed locally . &quot; It cannot be acceptable that in London you have luxury buildings and luxury flats kept as land banking for the future while the homeless and the poor look for somewhere to live . &quot; Mrs May met police and firefighters at a private visit to the site but was not seen speaking to residents who survived the attack . Mr Corbyn was pictured speaking to local people . Labour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan was heckled by some angry residents at the scene when he visited . Mr Khan praised the local community spirit but added : &quot; People are angry and I share that anger . &quot; Downing Street said that Mrs May &apos;s visit was made to get a briefing from the emergency services to ensure that they had the resources they needed . But Labour &apos;s former deputy leader Harriet Harman wrote on Twitter : &quot; Theresa May should have met Grenfell fire residents . She should have been prepared to listen to them Not OK to speak at them via TV . &quot; The prime minister has praised the way the local community had supported the residents and praised the &quot; professionalism and bravery &quot; of the emergency services . She pledged that the government &quot; stands ready to provide every assistance &quot; to the council and emergency services . &quot; I want to reassure the residents of Grenfell Tower - all of whom are in our thoughts and prayers - that the government will make every effort to make sure that they are re-@@ housed in London and as close as possible to home . &quot; She has ordered a judg@@ e-led public inquiry into the disaster . Ministers have also made emergency funding available to local authorities to support people affected . But MPs demanded answers in a specially-@@ arranged session in Westminster Hall on Thursday , while Parliament is still suspended . At the start of the special meeting in Westminster &apos;s Grand Committee Room , Fire Minister Nick Hur@@ d said : &quot; What we are dealing with here is a national tragedy . &quot; He said the &quot; exceptionally complex &quot; investigation would take several months , and there would be no room for &quot; pl@@ od@@ ding bureaucracy &quot; in the official response . &quot; It is the intention of the government to leave absolutely no stone unturned , &quot; he said . Answ@@ ers were needed about fire walls , sprink@@ ler systems , the alarm system and how the fire spread , he said . &quot; Every single person living in a high-rise building today will be frightened , will be traumatised and will be very , very worried . &quot; Shadow housing minister John Healey urged ministers to begin installing sprink@@ ler systems immediately and not to wait for the result of the public inquiry . The new housing minister , Alo@@ k Sharma , said he too had heard accounts of residents who said they had warned about fire safety . The government was talking to councils and housing associations about getting checks on other buildings done quickly , he said . At the end of the meeting , he promised &quot; every single family &quot; would be re-@@ housed in the local area . Earlier Theresa May ordered a full public inquiry , &quot; to ensure that this terrible tragedy is properly investigated . &quot; Labour is calling for measures recommended after another fatal fire in 2009 to be implemented immediately . Rec@@ om@@ m@@ end@@ ations made after a fire in a tower block in Lak@@ anal House in Camber@@ well in which six people died included installing sprink@@ ler systems in high-risk buildings and reviewing building regulations . In October the former Housing Minister , Gavin Barwell , said the government had &quot; publicly committed &quot; to reviewing building regulations in relation to fire safety after the Lak@@ anal House fire . Mr Healey said this review had &quot; not been started . &quot; &quot; The residents and others have some really serious questions to put to ministers and the people who run the building , &quot; he said . Responding to reports , the Department for Communities and Local Government said it was &quot; simply not true &quot; that a report about building regulations had been &quot; sat on . &quot; The BBC understands the Lord Chief Justice will make a recommendation to the prime minister of a judge to chair the inquiry . He or she will be independent from the government and able to call who they want as a witness . The Liberal Democrats have called for an urgent review into fire safety and building regulations .

S-114	Turning Points explores the moment when six people &apos;s lives change forever , and is produced and directed by Chris T@@ ally Evans , from R@@ hay@@ ader , Powys . Sir Roger talks about how a dialogue coach helped boost his confidence , which helped him forge his career . Turning Points has been made for London 2012 Festival , a nationwide arts event . The festival is running until 9 September and bringing together leading artists from across the world . Turning Points was premiered at Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff on Wednesday night . T@@ ally Evans said his film celebrated life changing moments when a meeting , an event , or something unexpected led to a new and better direction . It started as a nationwide stor@@ y-@@ telling project aimed at inspiring and changing the lives of others by collecting stories from people of all ages , abilities and walks of life . T@@ ally Evans , who has written and presented programmes for BBC TV and radio , said : &quot; It &apos;s fantastic to get the chance to have my work included in such a momentous festival and I &apos;m looking forward to the film transferring to the South@@ bank Centre in London ( from 31 August to 9 September ) . &quot; &quot; I think it was meeting a man in Hollywood , a dialogue director called Joe Graham . &quot; Warner Brothers thought that I sounded too English . They said : &apos; We &apos;d like you to work with this dialogue coach . &apos; &quot; He said : &apos; You think we &apos;re all born the same ? &apos; I said : &apos; Of course we are . &apos; He said : &apos; Some people are lucky , they &apos;re born 6ft 4@@ ins and some people are born 3ft 2@@ ins . Some people have got straight even features and some are not so pleasant on the eye . &apos; &quot; I said : &apos; That &apos;s the luck of the draw , isn &apos;t it ? &apos; . He said : &apos; Yes , but the big sin is if you don &apos;t use what you &apos;ve got &apos; . He said : &apos; You &apos;re 6ft 1@@ ins and you only stand 5ft 9@@ ins , so if you believe we &apos;re all born the same way then why don &apos;t you stand your full height ? &quot; &quot; He said did you go to university ? I said : &apos; No &apos; . He said : &apos; Do you regret that ? &apos; I said : &apos; Yes , I do a great deal &apos; . &quot; He said : Do you feel that sometimes when you &apos;re talking with people that you might mis@@ pron@@ ounce a word or you don &apos;t have the right word for the explanation ? &apos; I said : &apos; Yes &apos; . &quot; He said : &apos; Well , there you are . That &apos;s you &apos;re problem &apos; . And it made such a difference to my life . Joe was on the set everyday . He made a lot of difference to me , gave me a great deal of confidence , otherwise I wouldn &apos;t be able to talk to you . &quot; There will also be a showing at the El@@ an Valley Vis@@ itor Centre , near R@@ hay@@ ader , on 6 July . &quot; It &apos;s great that so many people have become involved in this project and I can &apos;t wait to see the effect their brilliant stories have on an audience , &quot; added T@@ ally Evans . &quot; There &apos;s a huge range of stories , about 100 in total , ranging from a printing press falling down a lift shaft to a eu@@ logy for a dead friend . &quot; Sir Roger , who is not shown on screen but has a speaking part in Turning Points , is joined by Welsh athlete Jamie Ba@@ ul@@ ch , an Olympic silver medallist in 1996 . Others taking part are artist Ellen Jackman , who lives in Birmingham , visually impaired dancer Lyn Street , from Newport , Daniel Chapman , an 11-year-old from near R@@ hay@@ ader who has autism , and the filmmaker himself , who is partially sighted . T@@ ally Evans said the stories were woven together to speak with one voice , while 11-year-old Morgan Evans , from R@@ hay@@ ader , runs through a Welsh landscape . Vi@@ br@@ ant images , sometimes ly@@ rical , sometimes satirical , add depth and colour to the stories as they reach an inspiring conclusion . There are other stories on the Turning Points website from Paralympic gold medallists Dame T@@ anni Grey-Thompson and David Roberts , world champion hurdler Dai Greene , former Commonwealth and European welterweight boxing champion Colin Jones and Olympic cycling gold medallist Geraint Thomas . In the film T@@ ally Evans explains how he came to terms with an hereditary eye problem , which left him partially sighted . A social worker told him his life was going to be different , and if he did not come to terms with it he would be a &quot; very unhappy man . &quot; &quot; I refused rehab , where I was supposed to go off to another city to be taught how to be a proper , grateful disabled person , threw the Bra@@ ille card in the bin and have lived exactly the sort of life I always wanted , &quot; T@@ ally Evans said . &quot; I never saw my social worker again . &quot; The film also has contributions from the former First Minister Rhodri Morgan and ex-@@ Formula 1 world champion Jackie Stewart . Nick Capaldi , Arts Council of Wales chief executive , said : &quot; Chris T@@ ally Evans brings his own unique insight to a series of personal tales , set against the inspiring Welsh landscape . &quot;

S-171	Younger people take religion seriously &quot; when they have the chance to learn about it , &quot; he said . And Cardinal Keith O &apos;Brien , leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland , urged Christians to wear a cross to symbolise their beliefs . It comes amid a growing debate about secul@@ arisation in British society . Meanwhile , the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh have attended traditional Easter Sunday service at Windsor Castle . During the service at Canterbury Cathedral , Dr Williams said it was the wrong time to &quot; downgrade the status and professional excellence &quot; of religious education in schools . RE is not one of the subjects counting towards the English B@@ acc@@ al@@ au@@ reate , the standard for ranking schools brought in by the coalition government . The English B@@ acc@@ al@@ au@@ reate ranks secondary schools in England according to the number of pupils who get good GCSEs in English , maths , science , another language and a human@@ ities subject - either geography or history . Supporters of religious education want to see it included in the human@@ ities category . By Robert Pig@@ ot@@ t@@ Religious affairs correspondent , BBC News During his decade as leader of the Church of England , Dr Williams has repeatedly complained that Christianity is being marginalised in British public life . Today he welcomed what he said was a reduction in active hostility towards religion , but issued a new warning . It was that &quot; serious and liber@@ al-@@ minded commentators &quot; were embracing religion as a socially useful tool - for example for re@@ thinking our &quot; destructive economic habits &quot; - but wanted to &quot; pick out the best bits of religion without all the embarrassing beliefs that go with it . &quot; The archbishop insisted that it was precisely those awkward beliefs - such as the actual resurrec@@ tion of Jesus - that mattered in Christianity , and that without them it would cease to make sense . His fear is that Christianity might survive the active hostility of athe@@ ists , only to succum@@ b to a kind of asset stripping which reduced it to a set of well-@@ meaning principles without really saying anything about God . But the government says it is already a compulsory National Curriculum subject and the English B@@ acc@@ al@@ au@@ reate is to encourage more students to take up geography and history in addition to RE - not instead of it . In his sermon , Dr Williams said : &quot; There is plenty to suggest that younger people , while still statistically deeply unlikely to be church@@ goers , don &apos;t have the hostility to faith that one might expect , but at least share some ... sense that there is something here to take seriously - when they have a chance to learn about it . &quot; It is about the worst possible moment to downgrade the status and professional excellence of religious education in secondary schools . &quot; Dr Williams said a hostility towards faith and religion in public life may have been tempered by a recent appreciation of the social value of religion . But he said the ultimate test of Christianity was not whether it was beneficial to the human race , but whether the resurrec@@ tion of Jesus Christ actually happened . He said that for Christians a vision of reconc@@ iled love between people &quot; is there only because God raised Jesus &quot; and that the answer was not in scientific proof , but by the way believers lived with and in their faith . The latest debate on faith in Britain was ignited after Conservative co-@@ chairwoman Baroness War@@ si warned that the nation was under threat from a rising tide of &quot; militant secul@@ arisation . &quot; The Muslim peer said in February that Europe needed to become &quot; more confident and more comfortable in its Christianity . &quot; Research carried out in the same month by a secul@@ ar@@ ist foundation suggested three-quarters of people who describe themselves as Christian in Britain displayed only a low level of belief and practice of the religion . The Ipsos Mori poll , for the Richard Daw@@ kins Foundation for Reason and Science , was rubb@@ ished by the Church , with Reverend Giles Fraser , former Canon Chancellor of St Paul &apos;s , saying it was not fair to trump people &apos;s &quot; self-@@ identification &quot; as Christians . In his Easter Sunday sermon , Cardinal O &apos;Brien told worshippers to &quot; wear proudly a symbol of the cross of Christ &quot; each day of their lives . He also voiced concern at the growing &quot; margin@@ alisation &quot; of religion . Dr Williams also issued a call for peace in the Israeli-@@ Palestinian conflict in the Middle East . He said : &quot; A visit to Y@@ ad V@@ ash@@ em , the Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem , will convince you why the state of Israel exists and must go on existing . &quot; A visit to any border checkpoint will convince you that the daily harassment and humiliation of Palestinians of all ages and backgrounds cannot be a justifiable or even sustainable price to pay for security . &quot; He said : &quot; We have to pro@@ d and nag and encourage the religious leadership in the Holy Land on all sides to speak as if they believed in a God who acts , not only a God who endor@@ ses their version of reality . &quot; We have to pray , to pray for wisdom and strength and endurance for all who are hungry for peace and justice , pray that people will go on looking for a truly shared future . &quot; In March , Dr Williams announced he would step down as Archbishop of Canterbury - the head of the Church of England - in December , after 10 years in the role .

S-46	At the start of each month Elena , a 40-year-old Mus@@ cov@@ ite , spreads all the family cash on the table and starts dividing it into small piles . &quot; When I do this I shake , I feel naus@@ eous , &quot; she says . &quot; This goes to one bank , that to another , then the third one ... There &apos;s one more bank , but we don &apos;t have the money for them - I had to go and buy some food . I guess we &apos;ll have to put up with their telephone reminders . &quot; Elena and her husband owe well over 1m roubles ( about £ 10,@@ 800 ; $ 17,000 ) to those four banks . After the cash piles are sorted the family of three is left with only 10,000 roubles ( £ 107 ; $ 167 ) . That puts them below the poverty line - and recently Elena lost her job . Millions of those in debt live like Elena . According to the Russian United Credit Bureau ( UC@@ B ) , 40 million Russians have loans or mortgages . By June , 12.@@ 5m of those loans had not been paid for at least a month , and in another 8m cases the arrears stretched back over three months . The Russian Central Bank says total personal debt has risen to 1@@ tn roubles ( £ 10.@@ 7bn ; $ 16.@@ 7bn ) . At least 10 % of that amount cannot be recovered by the banks . For Elena and her husband , this is a story of almost two decades of borrowing . They started getting loans in the mid-1990s to pay for their daughter &apos;s medical treatment . Then they took a bigger loan to pay off the smaller ones . It all seemed manageable , says Elena , but then new expenses came along - and two banks offered credit cards with generous conditions . &quot; We were a bit stupid , &quot; Elena says . &quot; They told us the minimum payment was 5,000 roubles a month and we paid that every month . But that was just the interest , not the loan itself . &quot; During Russia &apos;s boom years credit history checks meant virtually nothing . An individual already sad@@ dled with loans could take out another one , hoping to pay off previous debts . The small print was often too small to bother about . Then the music stopped . Money got tight after the 2008 global financial crisis and Western sanctions against Russia over its role in the Ukraine conflict . The average personal loan in 2014 was 5@@ 4,@@ 600 roubles . Olga Maz@@ uro@@ va is head of Sentinel Credit Management , one of Russia &apos;s largest debt-@@ collecting agencies . She says that often Russians are hit by a sudden drop in income , because &quot; the firm goes bankrupt , the working week is cut , there are lay@@ offs or wage cuts - we see that especially in industrial cities in Siberia and the Ur@@ als . &quot; Few Russians have insurance for such conting@@ encies , she says . Deb@@ tors cannot get much help . There are plans to amend the law on insolvency , to allow individuals to be declared bankrupt . But nothing will happen on that until October . Russian MPs decided that criminal courts were unprepared for the likely flood of such cases and that courts of arbitration should handle debt cases instead . Each deb@@ tor has to beg the bank to cut them some slack . But Russia &apos;s financial ombudsman Pavel Medvedev says that rarely works if someone owes money to more than one institution . A former adviser to President Vladimir Putin , he knows many top Russian financi@@ ers personally - but that does not help him to lobby on behalf of indebted callers . Typically , he says , lenders refuse to restructure personal debts with the words : &quot; I &apos;ve got a business to run and shareholders demand profits - I can &apos;t do it ! &quot; Mr Medvedev says his success rate in helping deb@@ tors has dropped from 51 % to 33 % and &quot; this year it &apos;s probably going to be around 16 % . &quot; He had no solution for one caller , Vladimir Fro@@ lov , living near Moscow . Mr Fro@@ lov started borrowing four years ago to help his partner , living separately from him , in Ukraine . The debts snow@@ balled . Finally , unable to get an unsecured loan , he mortg@@ aged the flat he shares with his elderly parents . His father Anatol@@ y , who co-@@ signed the agreement , is bewildered when asked which bank it was . &quot; How should I know ? They took us into some room , the light was dim and the print was tiny . I just asked if everything was alright and they told me it was . &quot; Besides the mortgage , Vladimir Fro@@ lov &apos;s parents took out two loans to help him , which eat up 18,000 of their 22@@ ,000-@@ rouble monthly pension allowance . And now Vladimir has defaulted on the mortgage . The bank is suing and they may well lose their only dwelling . &quot; There must be a normal way out - maybe give the bank a fixed share of my wages ? &quot; Vladimir wonders . But so far he has not found anyone at the bank to discuss his dilemma . &quot; Isn &apos;t there a law against this ? &quot; asks his father , equally helpl@@ essly . &quot; How can they let people borrow so much without checking them first ? &quot; After the good years many Russians are now getting a harsh lesson in capitalism - and inadequate regulations mean there is nothing to soften the blow .

S-357	Birmingham academies Park View and Nan@@ sen Primary - rated inadequate by Ofsted - will have their funding agreements terminated . Park View Educational Trust said it may be removed from running the schools . Old@@ know Academy and Golden Hil@@ lock School , also rated inadequate , were warned they could lose funding unless concerns were addressed . A head teacher at one of the Trojan Horse schools said parents tried to undermine her authority and descended on the school during an Ofsted inspection . The head teacher , who wished to remain anonymous , said she heard parents speaking to an inspector about her . She said she came close to quitting her job on a number of occasions but everything &quot; fell into place &quot; when news of the Trojan Horse letter broke . &quot; From 2012 I felt alone , &quot; she said . &quot; I did not know it was happening to other heads . If I had known , I could have ration@@ alised it but at the time I felt embarrassed . &quot; I started thinking &apos; maybe it is me , maybe I &apos;m doing something wrong . &apos; &quot; On Monday , the watchdog published 21 reports into schools allegedly targeted as part of a hardline Muslim takeover . Five of those schools , including Park View and Old@@ know , were rated inadequate . &apos; Islam@@ ic-@@ themed assemblies &apos; Birmingham City Council said it would work with Sal@@ tley School , the only local authority school placed in special measures , and the Department for Education to install a temporary governing board . In a letter to Park View chairman Tahir Alam , education minister Lord Nash said there were &quot; deep concerns &quot; about the way Park View School was run . The letter said : &quot; I have decided under clause 5.6 of the supplementary funding agreement for the academy to give written notice of the Secretary of State &apos;s intention to terminate that agreement . &quot; Lord Nash criticised the trust for failing to promote &quot; spiritual , moral , social and cultural development of pupils . &quot; &quot; I am deeply mindful of the need to eliminate discrimination , advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations , &quot; he said . A similar letter about Nan@@ sen Primary School , also addressed to Tahir Alam , said it would have its funding arrangement terminated . Both letters invited the trust to respond before 4 July . A spokesman for Park View School said they would challenge the Ofsted report through the appropriate legal channels . They said terminating the funding agreement would mean the trust could be removed from the running of the three schools . &quot; What happens to the schools after that would be the decision of the secretary of state , as they are already academy schools under the remit of &#91; the &#93; Department for Education , &quot; they said . In a letter to Dr Ach@@ mad da Costa , chair of Old@@ know Academy Trust , Lord Nash said it was not meeting the requirements set out in its funding agreement . &quot; Therefore the Secretary of State is minded to terminate the funding agreement unless all the breaches are addressed promptly , in full , and to his satisfaction , &quot; it said . Lord Nash set out a list of actions the trust must take before 4 July . These included ending &quot; less favourable &quot; treatment of non-@@ Muslims , cea@@ sing segregation of boys and girls , and drawing up a plan to ensure a more &quot; broad and balanced &quot; curriculum . Old@@ know Academy declined to comment on the letter from Lord Nash . A letter to Tahir Alam regarding Golden Hil@@ lock &apos;s funding arrangement set out a similar list of demands to be completed within the same timescale . Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw said &quot; a culture of fear and intimidation has taken grip &quot; in Birmingham schools , while a number of head teachers had reported an &quot; organised campaign to target certain schools in order to impose a narrow , fai@@ th-based ideology . &quot; &apos; Own agendas &apos; The report into Park View School said the academy &apos;s work to keep students safe , including from extremism , was inadequate . It said external speakers had not been vetted properly and the school had allowed a guest with known extremist views to speak to students as part of Islam@@ ic-@@ themed assemblies . Park View and Old@@ know trusts did not comment on the future but one of Sal@@ tley School &apos;s senior teachers said it hoped to boost its Ofsted rating . Darren Turner was brought in as associate head teacher on Thursday as part of a partnership scheme with other local schools . He said there had been &quot; upset &quot; among staff and pupils at Sal@@ tley &apos;s inadequate rating . &quot; This is all about moving forward , what happens next , &quot; he said . &quot; Behind these walls they &apos;ve got some excellent teachers and they want to get back to doing what they are good at : teaching . &quot; When this school gets back to &apos; good &apos; again we want to go further and become outstanding . &quot; Parents at the schools have criticised Ofsted &apos;s reports and accused inspectors of bias . Health professional Ar@@ shad Malik told the BBC the findings were &quot; alien &quot; to his child &apos;s experience at Park View . &quot; â € Ž@@ Inspectors came with loaded questions , &quot; he said . &quot; People are trying to use this school to push their own agendas . &quot; He said parents would like to invite Education Secretary Michael Gove to the school for an open meeting about Ofsted &apos;s findings and to talk about what evidence was found to support them .

S-149	Last weekend , the country was declared free of the virus that killed almost 4,000 people in the country over the past 18 months . He told the BBC &apos;s Richard Hamilton about his experiences in the civil war , which ended in 2002 , and his Ebola work : I had a normal family life before the war started in 1991 . But at 15 I was kidnapped by the Revolutionary United Front ( R@@ U@@ F ) rebels and taken to the jungle where I was trained on how to use a gun and initiated into the group . I thought it was the end of my life . It was like living in a different world , not like living on earth . They used a blade to cut the letters R@@ U@@ F into my chest , so if I was thinking about escaping I knew that I could be killed if I got caught by militia who supported the government . The rebels also threatened to cut off my legs or arms if I tried to flee , and I saw this happen to other people . Sometimes they would even take out the heart from someone &apos;s chest and cook it up with onions and ask people to eat it . It seems like a nightmare now . I remember when we used to look for food and demanded that people hand it over . If they said : &quot; We don &apos;t have food , &quot; we told them they were lying , and then we beat them even if they could have been telling the truth . Sometimes we were forced to kill , which we did under the influence of drugs : Mari@@ juana was very easy to take - we used it like people drink coffee - and cocaine was also available . I was given the impression that if you took these drugs then you would be brave and if you were brave you would have the opportunity in the jungle to climb up the ranks . Luckily I did manage to escape from the jungle without being killed and I went to the capital , Freetown , but was unable to find my relatives . I lived alone , but teamed up with some guys doing things like pick@@ -@@ pock@@ eting and I was caught . Fortunately &#91; while in jail &#93; I met a preacher called Richard Cole , who was the founder of a project called Li@@ feline Ne@@ hem@@ iah which aimed to give hope , and a home , to people like me who felt they had lost hope . He encouraged me saying : &quot; You used to cause atrocities , but you can be used to contribute to rebuild the nation . &quot; At the home he encouraged me to continue with my schooling , he also told me that guys like me would be leaders of the nation and help to rebuild it . Richard taught me that it was God who was taking me through all these troubling times , and I also learnt that it was important to give back what was invested in me . He passed away in 2006 but we had that vision and continue with it . When the Ebola crisis came to Sierra Leone in 2014 we considered it to be a common enemy . We were not medical practitioners but we had the passion to change things and we decided to develop our clinic to bring in suspected Ebola cases . Through this so many lives were saved . There were three key activities . We started with education as people found it difficult to accept that Ebola was real . So we started visiting communities and explaining that it was real and it was a death sentence . We educated more than 10,000 people , and explained the message in their languages - Tem@@ ne , K@@ rio and Lim@@ ba . Secondly we started supporting people by giving them food and other items . This became a massive operation - visiting 11,000 people - and started giving fresh food in urban and rural areas . Thir@@ dly we were able to team up with other agencies and put up an Ebola treatment unit that saved so many lives . People were frightened . Sometimes when we visited people refused to accept us but as we kept coming back we became familiar to them . It was scary and some people said it was witch@@ craft , but we persuaded them that there were principles to observe to protect themselves . One of the worst incidents I witnessed was when I saw a pregnant woman with suspected Ebola lying in front of us . There were three others in the house who were also suspected cases and no-one could come to their house because it was too dangerous . When I saw that woman lying there I felt very bad , I came out and talked with other volunteers and after that we started to set up an Ebola treatment clinic . We didn &apos;t have any funds but we had a lot of help from local chiefs and the community , and that was how it started . Now I see my life as a changed person . I regret all that I did , but I am confident now that the future is great . We are investing in young people ; I believe young people have a role in changing the world , not only Sierra Leone but the world . If we invest in them then we are building the future . 1@@ 1,3@@ 14 Deaths - probable , confirmed and suspected ( Inclu@@ des one in the US and six in Mali ) 4,@@ 80@@ 8 Liberia 3,9@@ 55 Sierra Leone 2,5@@ 36 Guinea 8 Nigeria

S-81	Media playback is not supported on this device The Spaniard became the only man to win three times so far this season . He drove a controlled race and stayed just far enough ahead of his pursu@@ ers to maintain the lead . Great strategy calls from the team to keep me ahead through the pit stops . I knew it would be a long race to the end Button climbed up from sixth on the grid to pass Vettel at the second pit stops but was re-@@ passed with two laps to go . However , the Englishman was promoted to second place after race stewards gave Vettel a 20-@@ second penalty for his overtake of Button on the penultimate lap . Lewis Hamilton retired with gearbox damage after running well down the field following an early puncture . But he will not incur any penalty for a gearbox change because of his retirement . The result extends Alonso &apos;s championship lead to 34 points ahead of Red Bull &apos;s Mark Webber who had a low-key race to eighth place , never showing any real pace . Alonso said : &quot; It was tough , not an easy race . Maybe we were not the quickest in dry conditions but we were competitive and it was enough to maintain the lead . &quot; Great strategy calls from the team to keep me ahead through the pit stops . I knew it would be a long race to the end , with Jenson putting pressure . &quot; But the car was feeling good on top speed and traction and that was enough to keep the lead into Turn 6 , and after that overtaking is not so easy . &quot; Media playback is not supported on this device The only consolation for Hamilton on the occasion of his 100th grand prix was that the McLaren showed encouraging pace following a major performance upgrade . At one stage , Hamilton un@@ l@@ apped himself on Vettel - although not Alonso - as he attempted v@@ ain@@ ly to recover from his early set-@@ back . A move which angered the double world champion . Alonso was never very far in front but was always able to stay just far enough ahead of first Vettel and then Button to ensure they could not use their D@@ RS overtaking aids to pass him into the hair@@ pin at Turn 6 . It led to a tense grand prix in which the identity of the winner was always in doubt until Alonso took the chequered flag . The Ferrari made a lightning start from pole position and although Vettel quickly closed up the initial gap Alonso had built on the first lap , the Spaniard was able to pull clear before their first pit stops to ensure he held the lead into the second stint . Meanwhile , Button was fighting past Hulkenberg and then Schumacher , to move quietly into third place . Vettel emerged from his first pit stop five seconds ahead of Button but the McLaren closed remor@@ sel@@ essly on the Red Bull and passed the German by making his second stop a lap earlier . Vettel emerged from the pits to find Button on his outside on the run to Turn 2 , and the McLaren easily took the position . Button was rarely more than a second behind Alonso from then until the end of the race but the Ferrari driver was always in control and in the closing laps he stretched away as Button began to lose grip in his rear tyres . Rather than try to take the lead , Button had to spend the closing laps fighting off a late challenge from Vettel , who passed him at the Turn 6 hair@@ pin on the penultimate lap . Vettel said : &quot; The pace was there but it was extremely difficult when I was close to Fernando and Jenson we seemed to lose a lot and not be able to stay close enough to try to something under braking . &quot; I am not entirely happy , it could have been a bit better if it was clean air most of the race but that was not the case . Second place was the best we could get today and I am happy with that . &quot; Button said : &quot; It was a close race and I couldn &apos;t quite get Fernando at the end . &quot; When you are in the middle of three you really have to fight and I was pushing a little bit more in the early part of the stint , whereas when you &apos;re in front you can coast a bit in the bits where you don &apos;t need to push . &quot; It was close but Fernando knows as we all do where to use K@@ ers to keep someone behind you . I ran out of steam at the end of the straight and the gap was a little bit too big to get back . &quot; But it was a fun race and it &apos;s nice to be on the podium again . I &apos;ve had my feeling back the last two races but the pace hasn &apos;t been there &#91; in the car &#93; , but today it was . We &apos;re there or ther@@ eabouts at the front , still a little way to go . &quot; Raikkonen provided some exciting racing as he moved up from 10th on the grid . On the way , Raikkonen engaged in top-class racing with Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher and the Force Indi@@ as of Nico Hulkenberg and Paul di R@@ esta . Schumacher finished seventh behind Sauber drivers Kam@@ ui Kob@@ ay@@ ashi and Sergio Perez . Hulkenberg and Di R@@ esta took the final points positions in ninth and 10th .

S-305	Town were rewarded for their greater control and threat when the outstanding Mooy smashed a 25-yard shot into the top corner after the break . Leeds , who slip to third from bottom with just one win from their first six league fixtures , rarely threatened . Town held on to go four points clear thanks to a fifth win from six . On-loan Manchester City midfielder Mooy was not certain to play after a hectic international break which saw him appear in both of Australia &apos;s World Cup qualifiers . But he dictated the play as the Terriers had the better of a dull first half in which neither side could muster a shot on target . Mooy , who was booked late in the first period for a n@@ ast@@ y-@@ looking lunge that infuriated Leeds manager Garry Monk and his coaching staff , came closest with a decent low strike . But his second attempt on goal 10 minutes after the restart proved much more successful and was reward for the visitors &apos; urgency and superior quality . Chris Wood sent a header wide for Leeds before the break and could have snatched a barely deserved point late on , but failed to properly connect with another headed opportunity . Leeds head coach Gary Monk : &quot; I &apos;m disappointed with the result , of course . We went out there with the intention of trying to grab the initiative but partly due to the way ( Huddersfield ) set up it became a bit of a nothing game . &quot; We have to get a real reaction now on Tuesday . We need to take the three points , it &apos;s as simple as that . &quot; It &apos;s very important that we get this Elland Road monkey off our backs and get the three points . &quot; Huddersfield head coach David Wagner : &quot; There is every reason to be surprised . I don &apos;t know which team in this division can say they will start with 16 points after six games . &quot; We have deserved every one of the 16 points and we said at the start of the season we would play every single game and give ourselves no limits and at the moment we have great togetherness and a very good working attitude , especially in the defence . &quot; I think it isn &apos;t comfortable for the opponents against us at the moment . &quot; Match ends , Leeds United 0 , Huddersfield Town 1 .

S-254	United Nations officials rarely use the words &quot; genocide &quot; and &quot; ethnic cleansing , &quot; but they now say potentially both could envel@@ op the world &apos;s youngest country . Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equ@@ at@@ oria states of South Sudan , 3@@ 40,000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda . That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200,000 people have fled Syria in 2016 . Every day , on average , another 2,500 South Sudanese become refugees , and the stories of what they escaped and what they saw on the way , add to the evidence of killing , rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines . Nelson Lad@@ u Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Bu@@ sia . A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres . The first time he crossed was with his immediate family ; the second - a day later - was with his brother &apos;s wife and her five children who he had gone back to help . Six@@ -year-old Mor@@ is@@ wani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road . I asked him what they had left behind . &quot; They are killing people , sleeping with wives , stealing . They are not shooting you , they are cutting you with a knife . Even small children can be beaten down , &quot; Mr Thomas told me . The children gul@@ ped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun . &quot; They don &apos;t want us , &quot; he said , and gave his explanation of why his town of Y@@ ei , just 80km ( 50 miles ) from the border , had become a place he had to leave . &quot; These tribes of Din@@ ka , they don &apos;t want Equ@@ ator@@ ians , they don &apos;t want ... Nuer . They don &apos;t want them . &quot; Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan . The civil war began as a dispute between the Din@@ ka President Salva Kiir , and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer . Equ@@ ator@@ ians only started to be targeted in July , when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital . In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre , O@@ ti@@ ma Amos , 21 , explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children , and among them two-year-old twins . &quot; We walked up to here - without any other form of transport , &quot; he said . &quot; It was very hard because they were killing people . If you were a boy you would be killed , if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you . If not , you would be killed . &quot; They were afraid they would be caught as they tried to escape . Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees . With the help of aid agencies , within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tar@@ pa@@ ulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops . Fa@@ ida Sarah arrived in August with her children , but already has ok@@ ra ready to harvest as well as onions , tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground . The reason she left Y@@ ei was because one night soldiers came round to her home , demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house . In July B@@ idi B@@ idi was a village , but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres . But now home to nearly a million refugees , Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach . &quot; This has been un@@ rel@@ enting since July , &quot; said Na@@ sir Abel Fernandes , the UNHCR &apos;s senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda . &quot; The international community has to pay attention , and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this , as it &apos;s a massacre of civilians from both sides . &quot; He says supplying water to the refugees is a problem , as it has to be tr@@ ucked in . As many as half the refugees are children , and schools are already running - exams were being marked and a presentation prepared for our visit . Girls sang and danced in a circle then Patricia Mercy , 16 , stepped forward with confidence to deliver her poem . &quot; War , war , war , &quot; she began , &quot; who are you and where do you come from ? &quot; The confidence and resilience of her performance hiding deep trauma . &quot; You have killed my mother and father , even my brothers and sisters , leaving me to be called an or@@ p@@ han . &quot; There are so many terrible stories here of what South Sudan is doing to its own people .

S-390	After a dra@@ b game with few chances for either side , Mohamed Salah teed up El Said , who struck firmly past Uganda keeper Denis Ony@@ ango on 89 minutes . Uganda &apos;s Joseph O@@ cha@@ ya earlier had a goal correctly disallowed for offside . The win means Egypt play Ghana on Wednesday with top spot of Group D still at stake , while Uganda are out of their first tournament since 1978 . Ghana secured their place in the quarter-finals with a 1-0 victory over Mali earlier on Saturday . On a deteriorating pitch in Por@@ t-@@ Genti@@ l , seven-@@ times champions Egypt failed to break down a resolute Cran@@ es defence for long periods . Ony@@ ango made an impressive clearing header to deny the on@@ rushing Salah at the end of an otherwise lifeless first half . Uganda began the second half brightly , forcing veteran Egypt goalkeeper Es@@ sam El Had@@ ary to punch several set-pieces clear but ultimately failed to register a shot on target as O@@ cha@@ ya turned in Far@@ uk@@ u Mi@@ ya &apos;s through ball from a clearly offside position on 52 minutes . El Said blasted a shot well over when unmarked and Mar@@ wan Moh@@ sen went close for the Phar@@ a@@ ohs with a header , but Egypt appeared to be heading for their second consecutive goalless draw . However , an otherwise quiet Salah showed great composure late on to check his shot and play in El Said with a reverse pass , the substitute &apos;s close-range shot evading Ony@@ ango . Uganda now face Mali in the final round of group games on Wednesday , with Mali needing a win and for Ghana to beat Egypt by two goals or more if they are to qualify .

S-43	The columnist told the newspaper last month that he had been diagnosed with the &quot; full English &quot; of cancers . Gill , who had been having chemotherapy , said that he did not &quot; feel cheated &quot; and had been &quot; very lucky &quot; in his life . Sunday Times editor Martin I@@ vens said Gill had been &quot; a giant among journalists &quot; and the &quot; heart and soul &quot; of the paper he joined in 1993 . The final column by Gill , about coming to terms with his diagnosis , will be featured in tomorrow &apos;s Sunday Times . In a statement sent to staff on Saturday , Mr I@@ vens said : &quot; It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning . &quot; Adrian was sto@@ ical about his illness , but the sud@@ den@@ ness of his death has shocked us all . &quot; He added : &quot; He was the heart and soul of the paper . His wit was in@@ comparable , his writing was dazzling and fearless , his intelligence was matched by compassion . &quot; Adrian was a giant among journalists . He was also our friend . We will miss him . &quot; Writing about his illness in November , Gill had said he had &quot; an embarrassment of cancer , the full English . &quot; There is barely a mor@@ sel of off@@ al not included . I have a truc@@ ker &apos;s gut@@ -@@ buster , g@@ imp@@ y , mal@@ evolent , me@@ aty mal@@ ign@@ ancy . &quot; Writers , broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author , who was known for dict@@ ating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia . Jay Rayner , the broadcaster and writer , tweeted that Gill had been a &quot; controversi@@ alist &quot; but also &quot; a kind man and a brilliant writer . &quot; Sunday Times political editor Tim Ship@@ man described Gill as &quot; the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times . &quot; &quot; The best of us for 30 years has died . Very sombre mood in the office , &quot; he added . Times Liter@@ ary Supplement editor Sti@@ g Abell tweeted that Gill had been &quot; the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style . &quot; John Wi@@ ther@@ ow , editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012 , said Gill had been extraordinary and unique . &quot; In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times , he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine . &quot; Another former editor , Andrew Neil , added : &quot; H@@ ired AA for Sunday Times in 1993 . He never forgot what he saw as huge favour . As one of finest writers of our time , he was doing the favour . &quot; Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had &quot; tr@@ ashed &quot; him for 20 years , but always did so &quot; with magnificently eloqu@@ ent savag@@ ery &quot; as well as &quot; an irrit@@ ating ker@@ nel of truth . &quot; While his writing remained popular , Gill &apos;s articles often caused controversy . In October 2009 , he described how he had shot a bab@@ oon while in Tanzania , prompting outrage from animal rights groups . In 1998 , he described the Welsh as &quot; dark , ugly little trolls &quot; - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Rac@@ ial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as &quot; a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile . &quot; In a critical review of a Norfolk pub , he referred to the county as the &quot; hernia on the end of England , &quot; while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it &quot; sm@@ elled of boiled washing . &quot; In 2010 , he was cen@@ sured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Bal@@ ding &apos;s 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme , in which he described her as a &quot; dy@@ ke on a bike . &quot; He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay &apos;s restaurants , along with his dining partner , actress Joan Collins . Born in Edinburgh in 1954 , Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer . He went to the independent St Christopher School in Let@@ ch@@ worth Garden City , Hertfordshire , and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art , in London . He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines , before writing for Tat@@ ler and then the Sunday Times . His first marriage was to author Cres@@ sid@@ a Connolly in 1983 . He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd , who was then a venture capitalist , in 1991 . They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced . Gill &apos;s illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years , Nicola Form@@ by , with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac . He said he had been &quot; surprisingly excited &quot; to be getting married to Ms Form@@ by , who he often referred as &quot; The Bl@@ onde &quot; in his restaurant reviews .

S-6	The biologist and entrepreneur turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race and , in so doing , was vilified by the scientific community . Dr V@@ enter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements . &quot; Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel ? Yes , &quot; he was once quoted as saying . And he is a very wealthy user of L@@ ear Jets and private yachts . But his efforts in the field of human gen@@ omics have undeni@@ ably helped speed up the entire process . After the publication of the human genome , Dr V@@ enter turned his attention to another grand project : the creation of a synthetic life form . Scientists at the US-based J Craig V@@ enter Institute have been bus@@ ily working on the endeavour for more than a decade . They have now published details of the result , an organism called Syn@@ thia , in the prestigious journal Science . Born in 1946 , as a boy , Dr V@@ enter did not exempl@@ ify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing plea@@ sures of the beaches in Southern California . Three years later , in 1967 , he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict . As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da N@@ ang , he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the T@@ et offensive . This inspired two important changes in him : a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted . &quot; Life was so cheap in Vietnam . That is where my sense of urgency comes from , &quot; he said . During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice . By the 1980s , the early days of the revolution in molecular biology , he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of dec@@ oding genes . But the work was messy , te@@ dious and agonisingly slow . So , in 1987 , when he read reports of an automated dec@@ oding machine , he soon had the first one in his lab . This spe@@ eded things up - but not enough . Then came Dr V@@ enter &apos;s real breakthrough . He realised that he did not need to traw@@ l the entire genome to find the active parts , because cells already use those parts naturally . He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules ( called R@@ NA ) that a cell makes from that blueprint . He was then able to chur@@ n out gene sequences at unprecedented rates . His success shocked some , most notably the co-@@ disc@@ over@@ er of DNA , James Watson , who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work &quot; any monkey &quot; could do . The criticism , and the failure to secure further public research funding , prompted Dr V@@ enter to leave the NI@@ H in 1992 and set up a private research institute , The Institute for Gen@@ omic Research . And , in 1995 , he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first , complete genome of a free-@@ living organism , Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us influ@@ en@@ z@@ ae , a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis . His greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998 , when he announced the formation of a commercial company , Cel@@ era Gen@@ omics , to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years . At that point , the public project was three years into a 10-year programme . Both efforts published their results in 2001 . What some saw as Dr V@@ enter &apos;s disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him op@@ prob@@ ri@@ um in some circles . Nevertheless , the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure . In 2006 , he formed the J Craig V@@ enter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world &apos;s first synthetic life form . Dr V@@ enter kept the scientific journ@@ als and the media ab@@ re@@ ast of developments , trum@@ pe@@ ting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal . But he has pursued other projects in the meantime . Dr V@@ enter has ro@@ amed the oceans in his yacht , Sor@@ cer@@ er II , collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt . The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea , to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins . The synthetic life breakthrough , when it was announced , was not without controversy . But Dr V@@ enter will have come to expect that . &quot; I think they &apos;re going to potentially create a new industrial revolution , &quot; he said of the synthetic microbes . &quot; If we can really get cells to do the production that we want , they could help we@@ an us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide . &quot;

S-300	Little is beyond their reach . Official documents and private communications are made public , and websites blocked . They hijack CCTV cameras , electronic billboards and network printers . The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops , the Cyber Berk@@ ut and Anonymous International . All three present themselves as independent activists , separate from other , government-@@ sponsored groups . The most prominent pro-@@ Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops , led by Ki@@ ev@@ -based program@@ mer Yev@@ hen D@@ ok@@ uk@@ in . Most recently , he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia &apos;s Rostov region - bordering Ukraine &apos;s eastern separatist regions . &quot; I gave all this data to Ukraine &apos;s security service , but they still can &apos;t get round to analysing it , so do it yourselves , &quot; he urged readers on Facebook . Volunteer activist group In@@ form Nap@@ al@@ m si@@ fted through more than 35 gig@@ abytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine . The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare , the distributed deni@@ al-@@ of-@@ service ( DDoS ) attack . &quot; DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops &apos; artillery , &quot; Mr D@@ ok@@ uk@@ in likes saying . Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests . To disrupt separatist funding , they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and Web@@ Money . The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware . On 8 December , Yev@@ hen D@@ ok@@ uk@@ in claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-@@ Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin . Some media reports suggest that Ukraine &apos;s security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire . But officials deny this . &quot; We only use data obtained by people we trust and know , &quot; Ukrainian military spokesman Olek@@ si@@ y D@@ my@@ tr@@ ash@@ k@@ iv@@ sky told the BBC . On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berk@@ ut , a staun@@ ch@@ ly anti-@@ Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych . The group &apos;s declared goal is thwar@@ ting Ukraine &apos;s military plans and thus stopping the &quot; genocide &quot; that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America &apos;s behest . Its motto is &quot; We won &apos;t forgive or forget , &quot; and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media . During US Vice-President Joe Biden &apos;s visit to Kiev on 20-21 November , Cyber Berk@@ ut hacked several Ukrainian government websites , placing a message on their front pages which read : &quot; Joseph Biden is the fas@@ cists &apos; master . &quot; Cyber Berk@@ ut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden &apos;s team while it was in Kiev . The documents appear to detail Washington &apos;s military assistance to Ukraine . Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berk@@ ut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev , which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists &quot; war criminals &quot; and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict . They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-@@ counting systems ahead of October &apos;s parliamentary election in Ukraine , to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and deser@@ tions , and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko &apos;s website . In addition , Russian tabloid Kom@@ som@@ ol@@ skaya Prav@@ da quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berk@@ ut , in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 . The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified . Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin . It is otherwise known as b@@ 0@@ l@@ tai or Shal@@ tay Bol@@ tay , which translates as &quot; Hum@@ p@@ ty Dum@@ p@@ ty . &quot; What is not clear is whether it ob@@ tains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders . The group focuses on Russia &apos;s domestic affairs , but some of its material covers Ukraine . In November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces . And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Gir@@ kin , also known as St@@ rel@@ kov , who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine .

S-395	After the League Two side &apos;s bright start , two quick goals from Di@@ afra Sakho and Andre Ayew gave the Premier League side control before half-time . Sakho slotted in his first goal since November from Sam By@@ ram &apos;s pass , before Ayew tucked into the same bottom corner moments later . The hosts went close via Harry Pell &apos;s volley and Jordon Forster &apos;s header . James Collins and By@@ ram both could have added further goals for the visitors , who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton . The best moment for Cheltenham , who were unchanged from Saturday &apos;s 3-0 league defeat by Carlisle , came with Pell &apos;s low volley across goal , but on@@ rushing substitute Dan Holman could not quite get the required touch as he slid in at the far post . The two sides &apos; only previous meeting came at the same stage of this competition four years ago , resulting in a narrow 2-1 win for Hammers at their old home Upton Park . The fourth-@@ tier side performed respectfully again on Wednesday , but did not sufficiently test Hammers goalkeeper Adrian . Slaven Bilic &apos;s side could have won by a greater margin , but Robins captain Kyle Sto@@ rer cleared Angelo Ogbonna &apos;s fierce header off the line in the first half and , moments later , keeper Jonathan F@@ lat@@ t did well to stop Sakho turning in Ayew &apos;s low cross . Cheltenham &apos;s exit ended League Two &apos;s representation in the EFL Cup before Thursday &apos;s third-round draw . Match ends , Cheltenham Town 0 , West Ham United 2 .

S-157	But just north of the small market town of Kore@@ m , bright green fields and neatly terraced hill@@ sides surround a vast lake , and in the brand new local hospital , the ward reserved for severely malnourished babies is all but empty . Foreign aid is a notoriously difficult business - and much criticised . But if you &apos;re looking for results , then this vast climat@@ e-@@ change challenged country , led by a hugely ambitious and severely authoritarian government , is worth a visit . In the first decade of this century , the number of Ethiop@@ ians living in poverty dropped by a third . In the last five years , child mortality has come down by two-thirds . There &apos;s good reason to expect the trend will continue . &quot; Two years ago - before the hospital was built - this baby would have died , &quot; said a young doctor , Bet@@ gel Mek@@ on@@ n@@ en , as nurses fed an em@@ aci@@ ated one year old with fortified milk . &quot; We are grateful to Britain and the international community for their help , but I think we &apos;ll &#91; become self-sufficient &#93; in five or 10 years , &quot; he said . It &apos;s a sense of confidence one hears often in a country whose economy has been growing at close to 10 % a year for a decade . 227 child deaths per 1,000 in 1984 ; 64 in 2013 GDP growth in 1984 : -@@ 2.@@ 85 % ( a fall ) ; 10.@@ 5 % in 2013 GDP per head in 1984 : $ 205 ; $ 5@@ 68 in 2014 Population in 1984 ; 39.@@ 5 million ; 9@@ 6.5 million in 2014 Source : The World Bank Ethiopia profile Is Ethiopia &apos;s building boom mas@@ king poverty ? Have UK businesses missed the train in Ethiopia ? This week a big conference in Ethiopia &apos;s fast-growing capital , Addis Ababa , will discuss ways to finance ambitious new international development goals - with a growing focus on improving local tax collection , and fighting illicit capital flight , across Africa . For now , British taxpayers are giving over Â £ 300m ( $ 46@@ 6m ) a year to help fight poverty in Ethiopia . &quot; This is a place where you can see your money achieving something , &quot; said Tim Conway , who works in Ethiopia for the UK &apos;s Department for International Development ( Df@@ ID ) . &quot; Development processes always create winners and losers , but the vast majority are sharing in the growth . We &apos;ve learnt not to question &#91; the government &apos;s &#93; ambition too much because they &apos;ve quite often exceeded what we thought was possible , &quot; he said . But Ethiopia , like tiny nearby Rwanda , poses some difficult questions for democratic countries with good intentions . Both nations have achieved remarkable economic growth in the context of an often highly repressive form of governance . Critics accuse donors of quietly ignoring human rights abuses , or even of indirectly sustaining them . Mr Conway acknowledged there were a lot of &quot; hard arguments &quot; with Ethiopia &apos;s government , and &quot; there are policies we don &apos;t support , and won &apos;t . &quot; But he praised a bilateral partnership that &quot; is really quite effective . &quot; The clear hope , on both sides , is that with the right , sustainable , projects Ethiopia can we@@ an itself off foreign aid within the foreseeable future . Near the small hillside village of Ba@@ hari Hat@@ s@@ ra just outside Kore@@ m , we found 40-year-old Ad@@ mas@@ sie Mek@@ onen walking home with a simple wooden plough on his shoulder , after a day &apos;s work on the small field he rents . For the past four years he , his wife and 10-year-old daughter have benefited from a partly British-@@ funded programme that pays Mr Ad@@ mas@@ sie a monthly wage of about Â £ 20 ( $ 31 ) during the six-month &quot; food gap &quot; season before harvest , when the family has exhausted its supplies . In return , he works on a variety of public projects , chosen by the community - ter@@ racing the hill@@ sides , for example , to prevent soil erosion . The programme is a part of a recent shift away from giving foreign aid money to support individual governments , and instead to put it directly in the hands of the poor . &quot; It &apos;s hundreds of thousands of man-@@ hours every year ... it &apos;s restored the landscape , &quot; said Mr Conway . But the challenges ahead remain significant . Ethiopia &apos;s population is heading towards 100 million , with a quarter still living in extreme poverty . Sitting down in front of his simple wood and mud home , Mr Ad@@ mas@@ sie said the cash payments had , at times , saved his family from starvation . But he questioned whether he would ever be able to manage without them . &quot; I don &apos;t own any land . I rent my fields . I have to give half the crop to the owner as payment . &quot; I can work hard now , but I worry about what will happen when I get older . I will have to go to the city to find work , &quot; he said .

S-1	You might forgive Laura Trott and Jason Kenny for leaving Rio rather full of themselves . Five competitions between them , five golds won . As of Tuesday night , had the couple been a country they would have sat 13th on the medal table , above Jamaica , Kenya and Brazil . That would be to mis@@ understand what makes them tick . This is a couple who got engaged while on the sofa watching an episode of EastEnders . You might think too that it would get competitive around the breakfast table in the cottage they share just outside K@@ nut@@ sford in Cheshire . Kenny now has six Olympic golds from three Games , more than Sir Steve Redgrave and Sir Bradley Wiggins . Trott has four , more than any other British woman , and from one fewer Olympics . That would be to mis@@ judge their relationship . Cycling superstars on their own , together they can be almost ordinary , almost invisible . After the gold rush , after their tearful embrace in the Rio velodrome with the world watching on , that may be about to change . &quot; The difference in their characters is what makes it work for them , &quot; says Trott &apos;s father Adrian . &quot; Until he gets to know you , Jason is a little bit shy . He &apos;s quiet and understated . Laura is bubbly , chat@@ ty , just as you see in her interviews . &quot; If they were both like Jason , God only knows how they &apos;d talk about anything . And God forbid having two Laur@@ as in a household ! &quot; The relationship between the two began in the build-up to London 2012 , with Kenny about to come out of Chris Hoy &apos;s mus@@ cled shadow at his second Olympics and Trott about to experience her first . &quot; I remember seeing Laura at the velodrome years ago , &quot; says Kenny &apos;s mother Lorraine . &quot; I said to my husband , &apos; F@@ li@@ pping heck , you need to watch this young lady . &apos; She was in the elimination race , only a tiny thing , and she kept sprinting over the top of everyone . She was amazing . &quot; The first time I knew something was happening between the two of them was when Jason phoned me up and said , &apos; I &apos;m bringing Trot@@ ty home for a bacon but@@ ty . &apos; &quot; I said to him , &apos; Is she your girlfriend ? &apos; &apos; No , she &apos;s just a friend . &apos; &quot; She made herself at home straight away . Into the house , sat down , feet up on the sofa . &quot; We liked her from the off . She &apos;s a gir@@ ly girl , so I can talk make-up and clothes to her . It &apos;s such a treat - having had two sons , I &apos;ve had years of remot@@ e-@@ control cars and standing out in the rain , and at last I can talk to someone about posh shoes . &quot; Trott and Kenny are not the first couple to both win Olympic golds . Some ( Steff@@ i Graf , ladies &apos; singles 1988 , Andre Ag@@ assi , men &apos;s singles 1996 ) have carried more global renow@@ n . Others have also won gold in the same sport at the same Games , most recently tri@@ athletes Jan Fro@@ den@@ o and Emma Snow@@ s@@ ill at Beijing in 2008 . But no-one at a summer Games has more . No-one else gets even close . Neither has the British duo finished . Trott is 24 , Kenny 28 . The next Olympics in Tokyo are in their sights . &quot; When I first met Laura , what stuck in my mind was how she was on what she wanted to achieve , &quot; says her agent Luke Lloyd Davies . &quot; She said to me , &apos; I want to be the most decorated British Olympian of all time &apos; . I remember thinking , for a 21-year-old to have that determination is remarkable . &quot; She reminds me of &#91; former England rugby union player &#93; Jonny Wilkinson - that same dedication , the way nothing will fa@@ ze her in competition . Off the bike she is a really sweet 20-@@ something . She likes getting dressed up , she dreams of Mul@@ berry bags and Pr@@ ada shoes . But when her peers are out partying , she is burying herself in training . &quot; And there is nothing glamorous about the sessions each put in at the velodrome at Manchester &apos;s Sport@@ city each day . La@@ p after 250m lap , staring at the black line and scuffed boards , round and round , lac@@ tic in the legs , fire in the lungs . &quot; It hurts so badly , &quot; Trott once told me . &quot; It &apos;s like your legs are getting squeezed . You try to fight against it , but it &apos;s horrible , and they &apos;re just getting tighter and tighter . You &apos;re going slower and slower . &quot; Nothing has come easy . Born six weeks premature with a collapsed lung , Trott spent the first weeks of her life in intensive care . As a child she suffered serious asthma ; at the exact moment she first sat on a bike , aged four , her big sister Emma - who would go on to race professionally for the Dutch team Dol@@ man@@ s-@@ Bo@@ els - was crashing and breaking her leg at the bottom of the same hill . As a young girl she preferred trampol@@ ining to her bike , only to be forced to give it up after repeatedly passing out in mid-air . &quot; I kept getting dehydrated during sessions , because you had to go out of the room to get a drink , and I was

S-356	Yet in this election , it is way down the list of priorities for most political parties . Philip Hammond , himself a former defence secretary , has been reported as saying recently that &quot; there are no votes in defence . &quot; He does not recognise the quote , but the sentiment is largely borne out by the opinion polls which show defence just sc@@ rapes into the top 10 of electorate concerns , way behind the economy , the NHS and immigration . UK military interventions in Iraq , Afghanistan and Libya may have also contributed to a sense of combat fatigue among the public and a re@@ tic@@ ence by politicians to focus on the subject . James de Wa@@ al , a senior fellow at independent think tank Chatham House , says in this campaign , politicians have been &quot; on the defensive on defence . &quot; This election issue includes foreign policy and the role of UK &apos;s defence forces at home and abroad . Policy guide : Where the parties stand To find out Labour and Conservative policies on the subject you will have to pers@@ ev@@ ere to page 77 of both their manifestos . Even then they are pretty short on detail and do not really address the difficult decisions the next government is likely to face . So to help , here is a guide to some of the more sensitive issues being left out . Most analysts , and politicians , agree the world is becoming more dangerous and unstable , whether that is shown by thousands of migrants fleeing so-called failed states , the threat from Islamic extremism , or a more belliger@@ ent Russia . Yet at the same time , most European nations , including the UK , have been making significant cuts to their armed forces . The size of the UK &apos;s regular Army is being reduced from 10@@ 2,000 to 8@@ 2,000 . You could fit that number in Wembley Stadium and still have seats to spare . The Royal Navy now has a fleet of just 19 warships , while the RAF has been left with eight - soon to be seven - front-line fast jet squ@@ ad@@ rons . There are some things the UK military can no longer do - so-called capability gaps . The UK has no Maritime Patrol Aircraft . It has to rely on its Nato allies to hunt for Russian submarines near or in its waters . At the start of the last parliament , David Cameron could boast that the UK was the fourth biggest sp@@ ender on defence in the world . Now , according to the Stockholm International Research Institute , the UK has fallen to sixth place , behind the US , China , Russia , Saudi Arabia and France . A commitment to spend 2 % of the nation &apos;s wealth , or GDP , on defence is conspicuous by its absence . Only two smaller parties - UKIP and the Democratic Unionist Party - say they would continue to meet that goal . But all the indications suggest the UK will soon fall below the Nato threshold . Malcolm Chalmers , of the defence think tank Royal United Services Institute , says on current projections , UK defence spending will fall to 1.7 % by the end of the decade . If there are more cuts it could fall to 1.5 % . He calculates that defence would require another £ 25bn over the next five years to stay above 2 % . The military top brass know that is not going to happen . Their planning assumptions are based on flat spending plus an annual increase of 1 % in the equipment budget . Spending 2 % is not mandatory to Nato membership . Few states do , but it is tot@@ emic . The US will inevitably think less of a key ally that no longer lives up to that commitment , especially when David Cameron recently lec@@ tured others on the need to increase defence spending at the Nato summit in Wales . In US eyes , the UK &apos;s credibility will inevitably suffer if , as seems likely , it fails to meet the 2 % target . It is more than likely that any future government will have to make more cuts in defence . The question is by how much ? Over the lifetime of the last parliament , the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) cut its budget by about 8 % . With the Conservatives , Labour , and the Lib Dems promising to bring down the budget deficit , there will have to be more savings in public spending . None of these three parties say they would ring-@@ fence or protect defence , like the NHS or overseas aid . The MoD has reason to be nervous - it has the second largest non-@@ protected budget , after welfare , of £ 3@@ 4bn a year . Another Conservative-@@ led government plans to make savings of around £ 12bn a year . Shar@@ ed across the board that could mean the MoD losing at least another £ 2@@ bn@@ - £ 3bn of its annual budget . But Michael Clark , director of defence think tank Rus@@ i , says most of the political parties appear to be backing away from further big cuts , in part because UKIP has made defence an issue during the campaign . The Conservatives also appear to have limited their options . They are promising to replace Trident , to increase the defence equipment budget by 1 % a year , and to make no further cuts to the size of the regular army . Mr Clark says those commitments will make it hard to find &quot; significant savings &quot; in defence . But without raiding the MoD &apos;s coffers , he says , the Conservatives &apos; entire fiscal plans would &quot; go out of the window . &quot; Labour has been careful to avoid making similar commitments

S-308	Media playback is not supported on this device A World Anti-Doping Agency commission report has accused Russia of running a &quot; state-sponsored &quot; doping programme . And Warner said he feels sports other than athletics have reason to be concerned at how Russian sport is run . &quot; This iceberg spreads in two different directions , &quot; he said . &quot; I suspect there are probably four , five or six nations that athletics has a problem with . &quot; Commission chairman Dick Pound said Russia &apos;s athletics federation , Ara@@ f , should be banned from the Rio 2016 Olympics . Warner told BBC Radio 5 live : &quot; Every other international sport today should be looking at Russian sport and looking at whether the men and women who compete in their events are clean . &quot; &quot; They do not have robust anti-doping regimes . They are asleep on the job - and they have to be rooted out . &quot; Wada &apos;s independent commission , which examined allegations of doping , cover@@ -ups and extortion in Russian athletics , also implicated the International Association of Athletics &apos; Federations . The IAAF &apos;s former president Lamine Diack has been provisionally suspended by the International Olympic Committee , who have also asked the IAAF to start disciplinary action against the athletes named in the report . Ara@@ f has been told to respond to the report by Friday and Russia have defended their position . Acting head of Russia Athletics Federation , V@@ adi@@ m Zel@@ ic@@ hen@@ ok , said : &quot; There is an element of a political hit job here because quite a few things were described in the report in a biased way . &quot; Russia &apos;s sports ministry has said it will work more closely with Wada , Igor Zag@@ or@@ skiy , deputy director of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency , Ru@@ sada , told the BBC : &quot; There is always room for improvement . &quot; We are on that track and we &apos;ve been on that track together with Wada . We will continue this work on this . &quot; Warner says the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) , must be restructured to combat the problem . He revealed that he had spoken to IAAF president Lord Coe since Monday &apos;s publication of Wada &apos;s independent commission , which examined allegations of doping , cover@@ -ups and extortion in Russian athletics , and also implicated the IAAF . The 3@@ 23-@@ page report said that &quot; acceptance of cheating at all levels is widespread &quot; in Russia and suggested that neither Ara@@ f , Ru@@ sada , nor the Russian Federation can be considered anti-doping code-@@ compliant . The report also said the London 2012 Olympics were &quot; sabot@@ aged &quot; by &quot; widespread inaction &quot; against athletes with suspicious doping profiles ; accuses Moscow laboratory director Gri@@ gory Rod@@ chenko of asking for and accepting bribes and intentionally destroying samples he was told to keep ; and recommends that five Russian athletes and five coaches should be given lifetime doping bans . Media playback is not supported on this device Pound , who chaired the Wada investigation , said the situation was &quot; worse than we thought , &quot; adding that &quot; it may be a resid@@ ue of the old Soviet Union system . &quot; Warner backed the recommendation to suspend Russia from competition &quot; until they put their house in order , &quot; adding : &quot; If you punish one or two innocent Russian athletes for the greater good of the sport , that is a moral dilemma I am willing to grasp . &quot; He also suggested that Russia is unlikely to be the only country guilty of doping , saying that &quot; athletics has probably got some other nations to root out . &quot; He added that while &quot; there are undoubtedly drugs cheats in many corners of athletics , &quot; he believed systemic doping did not occur in nations in the Western world . During a special BBC Radio 5 live programme examining the independent report , Britain &apos;s marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe said : &quot; I don &apos;t think anyone is under the impression it &apos;s only Russia . &quot; On the same programme , former British sprinter Darren Campbell warned of &quot; darker days to come . &quot; He said : &quot; This report was about Russia , and they need to be punished if this holds up , but we &apos;ll lose sight on the bigger issues if we focus on Russia . It &apos;s about cleaning everything out . &quot; There &apos;s people talking about testing out in Kenya and Jamaica . We can &apos;t have rumours anymore . &quot; We need to understand how the Russians got away with it . How did this happen yet nobody knew ? &quot; No matter how dark and depressing it gets , change has to happen now . &quot; Coe , elected IAAF president in August , described the Wada report as &quot; alarming &quot; and has said he will seek urgent approval from members to consider sanctions against the Russian federation . The report found evidence of multiple rules breaches by IAAF officials and found the governing body to be &quot; inexplicably lax in following up suspicious blood ( and other ) profiles . &quot; Media playback is not supported on this device It has also been criticised for its handling of the allegations , with Coe himself describing claims about suspicious blood profiles involving some athletes as &quot; a declaration of war on my sport &quot; in August . On Monday , Coe said that &quot; if there are failings in our governance or our anti-doping programme I will fix them . &quot; But Warner says Coe needs to restructure the IAAF in order for it to effectively tackle the problem . &quot; This cannot be a one-man crusa@@ de , &quot; Warner told BBC Radio 4 &apos;s Today programme . &quot; He needs to ensure there is a bench

S-197	On everything from music to microw@@ aves , and taxis to train tickets . Consumers save money by doing their transactions on a computer or mobile phone . But not when it comes to banking . Customers of UK banks who use the internet pay just as much for overdrafts and fees as everyone else . These low-@@ maintenance customers rarely need to call their bank , let alone visit the local branch . From the bank &apos;s point of view , they are cheap to look after . Yet they get no price reductions . On the face of it , digital customers are getting a raw deal . Lloyds - the UK &apos;s biggest retail banking group - boasts that is has 10 million customers who access its services via the internet . In effect , those 10 million are paying for the other 12 million customers who still want a premium and personalised service ; namely the ability to go in to a centr@@ ally-@@ heated , business-@@ rate paying , well-@@ decorated and well-@@ staffed High Street branch , to speak to a human being . &quot; If I &apos;m just using online , and never go into a branch , or never ring a call-@@ centre , I would expect to get a better price , because otherwise I am subsidising those people who go into a branch , &quot; says Kevin Moun@@ tford , head of banking at Money@@ Supermarket . No bank will say how much its branch network really costs them . But Lloyds has no fewer than 1,300 such branches in England and Wales alone . And Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) spent £ 400m last year on refurb@@ ishments . Either way , transactions on the internet cost banks a tiny fraction of those in-@@ branch , or compared to the cost of processing a cheque . &quot; As a customer , if I am seeing that my behaviour brings down the operational cost , what &apos;s in it for me ? &quot; says Mr Moun@@ tford . &quot; I would expect something back . But unfortunately it doesn &apos;t happen . &quot; None of the big High Street banks offer their customers separate internet banking directly . However HSBC and The Co-operative Bank do so under separate brands . One of them is Sm@@ ile , the first full internet bank to be set up , in 1999 , and owned by the Co-op . Sm@@ ile customers borrowing £ 500 for a month benefit significantly . The cost is just £ 7.@@ 34 , as opposed to £ 17.@@ 40 with the Co-op . The other is First Direct , which - as a telephone and internet bank only - has much lower running costs than its parent brand , HSBC . Yet First Direct charges £ 8@@ 3.@@ 05 to fund a £ 500 overdraft for a month , only marginally cheaper than HSBC &apos;s £ 8@@ 7.@@ 52 . Mark Mullen , the former chief executive of First Direct - and now boss of A@@ tom Bank - is not impressed . &quot; I think it is astonishing that you can have banks with very different cost bases , very different sizes of banks , and very different histories of technology , yet somehow mirac@@ ulously they price just about the same . &quot; Others might wonder why , if Sm@@ ile charges £ 7.@@ 34 for an overdraft , and HSBC charges £ 8@@ 7.@@ 52 for exactly the same thing , more customers aren &apos;t switching ; or why the self-@@ evident benefits of internet banking aren &apos;t available more widely . The banks concerned argue that customers are unlikely to be charged the amounts listed above , as they would be advised to take out a personal loan instead of the more expensive overdraft option . In any case , the mainstream banks believe consumers should not be getting lower prices for banking online . They are acutely aware that differ@@ ential pricing would make life more expensive for older and vulnerable customers , who rely on a branch network , and often still use cheques . James Daley , the managing director of Fai@@ rer Finance , and a former campaigner with Which ? believes that banks have a social responsibility to provide an equal service for everybody . &quot; You start telling pensioners that they &apos;re going to have to pay twice as much for their banking services because they aren &apos;t comfortable with the internet - I don &apos;t think that would be the right solution . &quot; I wouldn &apos;t want to advocate a world where people who bank predominantly online end up with significantly better deals than those customers who have to use branches . &quot; So are online customers going to have to continue toler@@ ating paying over the odds for banking ? The answer to that could depend on the launch of A@@ tom , the UK &apos;s first truly internet-@@ only bank , sometime before Easter . Built from scratch , with just 150 staff at its Durham headquarters , A@@ tom will only offer access via the internet or an app . No branches , no call centres . As a result of its low cost base , it is promising cheaper prices . &quot; We would expect to be more competitive when it comes to some - not all - of our charges , and some of our costs , &quot; says Mark Mullen . For example , customers will not be forced to pay both an interest charge and a fee for an overdraft . And there will be no distinction between an authorised and an unauthorised overdraft . &quot; That &apos;s just nonsense , &quot; says Mr Mullen . But even if A@@ tom does offer its users a significantly better deal , the rest of the industry may not feel obliged to follow suit . In this market , competition does not work as it should . So without a significant

S-334	The hosts had been on top when the ball came off forward Sanchez &apos;s hand and ended up in the net on 34 minutes . He added a penalty in injury-time which was awarded after Sam Clucas was sent off for handball from Lucas Perez &apos;s header . In between , Hector Bell@@ erin and Sanchez both failed to hit the target and Mesut Ozil volleyed over the crossbar for Arsenal . Striker O@@ umar Ni@@ asse had Hull &apos;s best chances - his header and low strike forced Petr Cech into sharp saves - while Adama Diomande nodded over late on . Arsenal had been pressing for the opener before Sanchez &apos;s intervention . The visitors failed to clear Kieran Gibbs &apos; low shot and as the ball ric@@ o@@ cheted off goalkeeper El@@ din Jak@@ up@@ ovic on the ground it bounced off the Chilean &apos;s hand and into the net . For a deliberate handball , Football Association laws state : Media playback is not supported on this device On this occasion , Sanchez did not look like he purpos@@ efully pushed the ball into the net and he had little time to move out of the way after the ball came off Jak@@ up@@ ovic . After consultation with his assistant , referee Mark Clattenburg awarded the goal , but prior to that in the first half , Theo Walcott had a shot blocked by the hand of Clucas inside the area , for which no penalty was given . After the game , Hull defender Andrew Robertson told Sky Sports that Clattenburg had apologised to the Hull players after half-time . Robertson added : &quot; The ref told us he didn &apos;t give it because he wasn &apos;t 100 % sure . Not many referees can admit they &apos;re wrong , so it &apos;s good when he does , though it doesn &apos;t make things better . &quot; News app users should click this link to vote Chasing the game in the second half , Hull &apos;s Laz@@ ar Markovic was running onto a long pun@@ t forward deep in the Arsenal half . The Serb was barged down by Gibbs , who was the last defender , and had the on-loan Liverpool man not been infringed , he would have had a clear run through on goal from 30 yards . Clattenburg spotted the incident and presented a yellow card . Gibbs said after the game : &quot; I took a chance with the challenge on Markovic . The ref said the ball was going away from goal . &quot; When asked if Gibbs should have been sent off , Hull boss Marco Silva said : &quot; Yes . It is true . Markovic go to the goal . &quot; With Hull pushing for an equaliser , they were hit on the counter by the home side . Jak@@ up@@ ovic came sprinting off his line as Sanchez went round him and picked out Perez at the back post , but the Spaniard &apos;s goal-bound header was kept out by Clucas &apos; arm on the line . Clucas was given a red card for the incident . Sanchez stepped up to take the penalty , drilling a low finish into the net , which was his seventh goal against Hull in just four games . It was also his 17th top-flight strike this season , making him the league &apos;s leading mark@@ sman . Media playback is not supported on this device Arsenal had lost back-to-back league games against Watford and Chelsea to leave their title challenge in disarray . But the win moves them up to third in the table , nine points behind leaders Chelsea . For Hull , it was an unlucky defeat , having come close to scoring in both halves , but they have now failed to find the net in 12 of their 25 games - more than any other side . Despite the defeat , Tigers supporters will be buoyed by the impact made by new manager Silva as his side look well-@@ equipped for a battle to stay in the top-flight , yet they remain in the relegation zone by a single point . Former Hull defender Peter Swan on BBC Radio Humberside Hull City &apos;s performance was strong , and they did really all they could . The referee &apos;s decisions have hurt Hull today , but the side are showing they have got a very real chance of staying up . For the second goal , you have got to feel sorry for Clucas . His keeper has stitched him right up . It was an easy decision for Clattenburg . And do you want to know the irony ? Jak@@ up@@ ovic had probably made up the ground and was covering behind Clucas , not that the defender knew . Arsene Wenger speaking to Match of the Day : &quot; We were resilient , focused and organised , but a bit with the hand@@ brake on as we were under pressure to win the game . In the end perhaps we were fortunate to get away with a positive result . Hull boss Marco Silva told BBC Sport : &quot; The most important thing is the result . It was a very good second half . We had control of it and caused Arsenal problems . &quot; They started the game better than us and after the story of the first half they score with handball . We didn &apos;t deserve this result . Arsenal travel to Bayern Munich for the Champions League last-16 first leg fixture on Wednesday ( kick-off 19 : 45 GMT ) , while Hull host Burnley in the Premier League next Saturday ( 15 : 00 ) .

S-248	Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors led briefly through Va@@ sil Lob@@ z@@ han@@ id@@ ze &apos;s early try , but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour , a penalty try , Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break . Hamish Watson extended the lead , battling over soon after half-time . Lob@@ z@@ han@@ id@@ ze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum , before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack . Before the Scottish points deluge , it was the Georgi@@ ans who opened the scoring . It was a soft one , with Lob@@ z@@ han@@ id@@ ze , the visitors &apos; scrum-half , dar@@ ting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him , but didn &apos;t . The wing made amends soon after when Hogg din@@ ked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to . In the foot@@ -@@ race , Seymour beat Lob@@ z@@ han@@ id@@ ze to the tou@@ ch-@@ down . It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball , but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline . The floo@@ dg@@ ates began to open . Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul , destined for the try-@@ line , was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock , K@@ ote Mik@@ aut@@ adze . Scotland got a penalty try , converted by Laidlaw , and Mik@@ aut@@ adze got the sin-bin . Mer@@ ab K@@ vi@@ ri@@ k@@ ashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motor@@ ed on regardless .

Media playback is not supported on this device Georgia , living off scraps , put over another penalty to make it 24-@@ 11 but Hogg &apos;s try stretched the lead again . There was ambition and luck at its heart . There was nothing on for the full-back , so he ch@@ anced his arm , din@@ ked a kick over the top and chased like hell . The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre To@@ du@@ a and landed kindly in the on@@ rushing Hogg &apos;s hands . Away he went for Scotland &apos;s fourth try , once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw . The fifth came early in the second half , Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over . The conversion made it 38-@@ 11 . It was the bel@@ ated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own . They scored their second try when shov@@ ing Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum . They sh@@ unted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lob@@ z@@ han@@ id@@ ze was a formality . Georgia &apos;s scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-@@ prone Scotland problems . Moray Low was yellow-@@ carded in the midst of this for another buck@@ led scrum . The hosts had a rousing finish , though . Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half . Rory Hughes , another substitute , was on Price &apos;s shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland &apos;s sixth . Scotland head coach Vern Cotter : &quot; It was a good first half . We scored three pretty quick tries , and we held the ball so they couldn &apos;t access the game as they would have liked . We kept the ball down the other end , and when they gave it back to us , we managed to counter-attack and get points . &quot; In the second half , the game seemed to open up a little , it was a wet ball and it was cold out there , so the trans@@ missions weren &apos;t as neat and quick as we &apos;d like . And they were very good over the ball . &quot; But I thought we did things prag@@ m@@ atically , kept them out of it and scored points when we had to . &quot; I think there &apos;s been a good shift in the way we approach these games and manage them , and Greig ( Laidlaw ) &apos; s done a great job in that with his guys around him .

S-50	During the first nine months of 1938 , he oversaw the Czech Kin@@ der@@ transport , which brought Jewish children from German-@@ occupied Czechoslovakia to safety in the UK . He worked tirelessly to ensure money was raised and homes were found for the young refugees . Yet , amazingly , his self-@@ eff@@ acing manner meant that it was 50 years before the full story of his heroic efforts became public knowledge . Nicholas George Win@@ ton was born on 19 May 19@@ 09 in the well-@@ he@@ eled Hampstead district of north London . His Jewish parents had moved from Germany to London in 19@@ 07 and changed the family name from Wer@@ the@@ im to Win@@ ton . They had also converted to Christianity and it was into that faith that their son was bap@@ tised . In 1923 , Win@@ ton became one of the first pupils at the newly opened St@@ owe School in Buckinghamshire . Although he left without att@@ aining any qualifications , he had become im@@ bu@@ ed with a love of mathematics . He continued his studies at evening classes before moving to Germany , where he worked in banks in Hamburg and Berlin . In 1931 , just two years before Hitler became German chancellor , he moved to work in Paris before returning to London . His mother &apos;s family had remained in Germany and that , together with the stories of Jewish refugees fleeing to London , made him all too aware of the persecution of the Jews by the Nazis . In December 1938 , Win@@ ton had been due to go on a skiing holiday to Switzerland when he suddenly decided to travel instead to Prague , where a friend was trying to help Jewish refugees . He visited camps for refugees from the Su@@ de@@ ten@@ land , a German-@@ speaking area of Czechoslovakia , which had been ceded to Germany in September 1938 following pressure on the Czech government from Britain and France . British activists were already working in Czechoslovakia trying to help the refugees , but Win@@ ton &apos;s great idea was to rescue children by finding families in the UK to give them a home . He was helped by a 1938 Act of Parliament that permitted the entry of refugee children under the age of 17 , as long as money was deposited to pay for their eventual return home . Win@@ ton set up an office in a hotel in Prague , where he was quickly besieged by families desperate to get their children out before Germany invaded Czechoslovakia . On his return to London , he worked with relief organisations to set up the Czech Kin@@ der@@ transport , just one of a number of initiatives attempting to rescue Jewish children from Germany and the Nazi-@@ occupied territories . Win@@ ton placed dozens of newspaper advertisements pleading for people to come forward and offer children a home . It was not always easy . &quot; The problem was getting the people who would accept the children , and of course this was at a time when the evacuation of children from the south &#91; of England &#93; was taking place anyway , &quot; he said . &quot; It &apos;s marvellous that so many people did come forward . The unfortunate thing was that no other country would come along and help . &quot; I tried America but they didn &apos;t take any . It would have made a vast difference if they had . &quot; In the first eight months of 1939 , eight trains left Prague taking 6@@ 69 children to safety . A further 15 were flown out via Sweden . The ninth train was scheduled to leave Prague on 1 September 1939 , the day Germany invaded Poland and triggered the outbreak of World War Two . &quot; Within hours of the announcement , the train disappeared , &quot; Win@@ ton later recalled . &quot; None of the 250 children on board was seen again . &quot; We had families waiting at Liverpool Street that day in vain . If the train had been a day earlier , it would have come through . &quot; Win@@ ton registered as a conscientious obj@@ ector and served for a time as an ambulance driver , before joining the RAF where he was eventually commissioned . He told no-one about his pre-@@ war exploits and it was not until 1988 that his wife discovered a scrap@@ book in the attic containing a mass of documents , including the names of the rescued children . In July of that year , Win@@ ton appeared on an edition of the BBC programme That &apos;s Life , and some of the people he had rescued were invited to attend . Until they arrived in the studio , they had no idea that Win@@ ton was the man who had saved them . Win@@ ton was awarded an MBE in 1983 for his work in establishing the Ab@@ bey@@ field care homes and , in 2003 , was knighted in recognition of his efforts on the Kin@@ der@@ transport . In 2007 , he received the Czech Republic &apos;s highest military decor@@ ation , the Cross of the 1st Class , and was nominated by the Czech government for the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize . A train dubbed &quot; The Win@@ ton Train &quot; left Prague station on 1 September 2009 , exactly 70 years after the last Kin@@ der@@ transport had been due to depart from the Czech capital . In October 2014 , at the age of 105 , he travelled to Prague to receive the Czech Republic &apos;s highest honour , the Order of the White Lion . In his acceptance speech , he was typically modest : &quot; In a way , I shouldn &apos;t have lived so long to give everyone the opportunity to exagger@@ ate things the way they are doing today . &quot; It was another Nobel Peace Prize recipient , Holocaust survivor E@@ lie Wi@@ esel ,

S-72	Brad McKay cr@@ ou@@ ched to volley in Greg Tansey &apos;s deep free-kick early in the match . And Tansey converted a penalty after Massimo Donati had fouled Ross Draper . Accies were upset Ali Crawford was not awarded a second-half spot-kick for a challenge by goalkeeper Ryan Es@@ son but netted late on through Danny Redmond . The gap between Caley Thistle and Motherwell also stands at four points , with Well behind Hamilton on goal difference after losing to Ross County . The first-half performance was exactly what Inverness manager Richie Foran has been searching for and came with their backs planted firmly against the wall . They were terrific . Ad@@ versity sometimes brings out the best in people , although nerves did seem to take effect after half-time . Foran has said for some time his side just needed one win to get going . They have it and look capable of more as the pressure turns , at least temporarily , to sides above . Tansey , who has agreed a pre-@@ contract to join Aberdeen , was at the heart of the Saturday lunchtime victory . It was his delivery that found McKay gh@@ os@@ ting in and the defender &apos;s finish was perfect . Another Tansey delivery was rewarded when Donati wrestled Draper to the ground . Tansey took the responsibility and delivered under pressure . In truth , Inverness could have been out of sight by the break . Billy Mckay should have done better from close range twice and Alex Fisher somehow screwed a header wide from a few yards after Remi Matthews had parried Tansey &apos;s drive . And , in the second period , Scott Boden could have sealed the win when clean through but din@@ ked over . Martin Canning &apos;s side improved significantly after the break as Crawford and Redmond were sent on in place of Donati and Rak@@ ish Bingham . And Crawford thought he had earned a lifeline . As Gary Warren tried to shepherd the ball out , Es@@ son came flying out and inexplicably took the substitute down . Referee Andrew Dallas did not point to the spot , leaving Hamilton players in disbelief . It was a huge escape for the home side . Having offered little earlier in the match , other than a great chance for Darian MacKinnon which he prodded wide , the second-half response was firm . Dougie Imrie , Crawford and Greg Docherty all came close but ultimately they did not threaten enough and gave themselves too much to do after leaving themselves repeatedly exposed in defence . Redmond &apos;s late finish was little consolation , although the goal may yet have an important part to play in the final make-up of goal difference with so few points separating the sides .

S-193	Reporters Gavin Sher@@ riff and Darryl Smith worked for the Dun@@ de@@ e-based Sunday Post , which closes its London office on Friday . For decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation &apos;s biggest newspapers . Ex-@@ Sunday Express editor Robin Es@@ ser said it was once a &quot; very , very important place &quot; through which most of the public received its information . The first British daily newspaper , the Daily Cour@@ ant , was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 17@@ 02 . At its height , &quot; the Street of Shame &quot; - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist &apos;s career , with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-@@ mile radius . Mr Smith , 43 , worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years . He is quick to point out that the paper &apos;s London address is the same as Sweeney Todd &apos;s barber shop , where the fictional character took a razor to his clients &apos; throats . Although the death of journalism has finally arrived here , he says it was announced too soon by some of London &apos;s tour guides . &quot; I was standing by the window once a few years ago , and a tour bus had stopped outside . I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here . &quot; I stuck my head out and shouted : &apos; We are still here &apos; . &quot; The street was famous for its many bars and pubs , constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories , and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El V@@ ino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women . He says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-@@ fitting jacket , provided by the staff . &quot; There is so much history here , and to be one of the last ones , I feel un@@ worthy of the torch that I &apos;m carrying . &quot; Mr Sher@@ riff , 54 , has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years , and rose to become the Post &apos;s London chief reporter . He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-@@ filled newsroom to the sound of ty@@ pe@@ writers being bas@@ hed about . &quot; The phones didn &apos;t even work properly , I &apos;d be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time . &quot; His memories of the street in its heyday are of &quot; watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-@@ streets to printing presses and lots of pubs , filled with journalists and printers . &quot; &quot; Now it &apos;s an endless number of sandwich bars out there . Un@@ thinkable 30 years ago . &quot; Mr Sher@@ riff describes the atmosphere back then of &quot; certainly living up to the image you had before you came , but you wouldn &apos;t be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then . &quot; Following their redundancy , Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist , while Mr Sher@@ riff is taking time out to write his memoirs . Robin Es@@ ser &apos;s Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years , during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail . &quot; At its height , Fleet Street was very , very important because television was in its early childhood , and there was no social media . So 85 % of information to the public came through the newspapers , &quot; he says . &quot; The departure of its last two journalists should be marked , but you have to look forward , not backwards . &quot; Liz Hodg@@ kinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and her book , Ladies Of The Street , covers the story of women working there . &quot; Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street , with papers like the Sunday People , the Sun and the Mail , all in little streets actually off Fleet Street . &quot; But they were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street . &quot; When I was at the People we &apos;d have a conference at 11am till about noon . Then the editor would open his drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one . &quot; Then we &apos;d take a taxi to the Savo@@ y or Clar@@ id@@ ges for more drinks . We &apos;d come back about 4pm , and then go out drinking again around 5@@ pm . &quot; The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street . &quot; At the People there were four women in editorial , and 150 men . At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s , there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room , which was known as the Pir@@ an@@ ha Pool . &quot; I was working on an undercover job once for a paper , and rang an editor from a pay@@ phone , to check in with him . &quot; He asked &apos; Are you in danger , pet ? &apos; I replied &apos; Yes , I am &apos; . To which he replied &apos; Oh , good . &apos; &quot; But , like so many emp@@ ires before it , Fleet Street &apos;s grip on power began to crumble . Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers - consisting of the Sun , the now-@@ closed News of the World , the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose-built complex at W@@ apping in east London in 1986 . This led to a bitter , year-long dispute which sometimes turned violent , but

S-368	The network will comprise at least 600 spacecraft in the first instance , but could eventually en@@ compass more than 2,000 . The aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe . In particular , the project wants every school to have a connection . Building so large a constellation requires a step-@@ change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus . It can take Europe &apos;s biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today &apos;s specialist platforms . But for the One@@ Web venture , it is all about high volume and low cost . That means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes . The idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece . The boss of Airbus , Tom Enders , concedes he initially thought the One@@ Web concept to be fantasy . &quot; Everything in space as you know traditionally has been &apos; gold-@@ pl@@ ated &apos; ; it had to work perfectly , &#91; and have &#93; the most expensive materials , etc . &quot; Here , we &apos;ve had to go other ways , to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for One@@ Web , &quot; he told BBC News . Airbus and One@@ Web have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse , France . Two further lines will be set up in a so@@ on-to-@@ open factory complex in Florida . The most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite clean@@ room is the trolley robot , which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations . But the &quot; revolution &quot; here goes far beyond automation ; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan . The first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year . Another batch will follow into orbit around November . And then the launch cad@@ ence will kick on ap@@ ace . The establishment of the One@@ Web constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight . More than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32-@@ 36 satellites into a web some 1,@@ 200km above the Earth . There should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020 , the start of 2021 ; more than 600 about a year or so later ; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade . One@@ Web and Airbus are not the only companies planning a mega-@@ constellation in the sky . SpaceX , Boeing , Vi@@ a@@ S@@ at and others have all sought regulatory approval . But not everyone will succeed in getting the necessary multi-@@ billion-dollar financing , and Airbus believes the One@@ Web concept has first-@@ m@@ over advantage . Equity of $ 1.7bn has already been raised , and talks are ongoing to secure the loans needed to complete the roll-out . One@@ Web describes itself as a &quot; truly global company &quot; but it has company registration in the UK &apos;s Channel Islands . And , as such , it must deal with the UK Space Agency as the licensing authority . &quot; A lot of our revenues are going to flow through the UK . So , from an economic perspective , it is going to be very important for the UK , &quot; said One@@ Web CEO Eric B@@ ér@@ anger . &quot; And when you have people locally , you are also fostering an ecosystem . And I think the UK being at the forefront of regulatory thinking on const@@ ell@@ ations will foster an environment that puts the UK ahead of many countries . &quot; One aspect that the UK@@ SA is sure to take a keen interest in is debris mitigation . There is considerable concern that a proliferation of multi-@@ satellite networks could lead to large volumes of junk and a cas@@ cade of collisions . The fear is that space could eventually become un@@ usable . A recent study - sponsored by the European Space Agency and supported by Airbus itself - found that the new const@@ ell@@ ations would need to de-@@ orbit their old , redundant spacecraft within five years or run the risk of seriously escalating the probability of objects hitting each other . Brian Hol@@ z , who is CEO of the One@@ Web / Airbus manufacturing joint venture , said the ambition of his constellation was to set new standards in debris mitigation . &quot; We can bring down the satellites and re-enter within two years ; we &apos;ve made that commitment , &quot; he told BBC News . &quot; We &apos;ve put extra hardware into the system to improve the reliability of that de-@@ orbit process . We &apos;re also committing to put a small adap@@ ter device on to each spacecraft that will allow those spacecraft , in the small probability that one of them dies on the way down , to be grabbed by a small chase vehicle and pulled out of orbit . &quot; Time will tell how disruptive the new manufacturing approaches adopted in Toulouse will be to the satellite industry as a whole . Airbus and One@@ Web hope also to be making satellites for other companies on their assembly lines . But not every platform in the sky will require such volumes and a good number of spacecraft will still need the bespoke treatment . &quot; Not everything here is application to the whole space industry . When we launch to Jupiter , there are things that will remain gold-@@ pl@@ ated whether we like it or not ; unless of course we start to manufacture 900 satellites to go to Jupiter but this is not the case today ,

S-298	Grant Ward &apos;s scuffed shot put Town ahead before Luke Varney rolled the ball into an empty net after QPR keeper Alex Smith@@ ies mis@@ cu@@ ed a clearance . Cole Sk@@ use &apos;s long-range shot fell to Tom Lawrence , who capped the scoring with a calm finish into the corner . Rangers offered little in attack , but sub Sandro headed T@@ j@@ arr@@ on Cherry &apos;s corner against the post late on . Ipswich had failed to score in seven of their previous 10 Championship games , but could have had plenty more , with Christophe Berra heading wide from six yards , and Sk@@ use firing a volley straight at Smith@@ ies . The R@@ s have won only once in their last six matches away from Loftus Road , and rarely looked like improving that record in Ian Holloway &apos;s second game in charge . The win lifted Mick McCarthy &apos;s Ipswich up four places to 14th and above Rangers , who slipped to 15th . Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy : &quot; The irony was that poor old Alex Smith@@ ies cost them the second goal which set us up to win as comprehensively as we did . He then kept it from being an embarrassing scoreline , but I &apos;ll take three . &quot; With Luke Varney and also Jonathan Douglas , I knew what I was going to get - even though I bet some people weren &apos;t thinking that when they saw the team@@ sheet . Luke epitomised everything what I want in this team . &quot; We have not been bri@@ st@@ ling with confidence . I have had a couple of rotten weekends after Rotherham and Nottingham Forest . But hopefully Ipswich can be a happier place than it has been . &quot; QPR boss Ian Holloway : &quot; I am sure everyone will say everything hinged on the second goal , but it shouldn &apos;t have . &quot; The goal was a calamity and after that we were awful and it could have been four or five . &quot; Everyone will blame my keeper but I won &apos;t as my defenders should have made an angle for him . Even with my legs , I would have ran back and tried to help him . &quot; My players need to be mentally tougher as a group . I am disappointed with how we finished today .

S-148	It is seen as a response to the growing threat from Russian submarines which have stepped up their own patrols in these very same waters . It has also highlighted a gaping hole in Britain &apos;s own defences . For now though it is the hunt for U@@ 33 , not Red October . The German U-@@ boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves . U@@ 33 &apos;s commander Kai Nick@@ les@@ dorf and his 28 crew , who live in cramped conditions , are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships . Their task , for this exercise , is to try to take out the command ship , the USS Vick@@ sburg , and an oil tanker . When they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a per@@ is@@ cope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds . Up on the bridge of the USS Vick@@ sburg , R@@ ear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships , including the Royal Navy Fri@@ gate HMS Portland , to begin the search . He says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity . There have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden , Finland and the UK . He says the training &quot; focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it &apos;s not theoretical that we might have to do anti-@@ submarine warfare . &quot; For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy . It has been likened to looking for a needle in a ha@@ yst@@ ack . Up on the bridge of the USS Vick@@ sburg , the crew scan the horizon looking out for a per@@ is@@ cope . Down below , in a dark@@ ened room in the bow@@ els of the ship , sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors . Lieutenant Colin Ryan , Vick@@ sburg &apos;s anti-@@ submarine warfare officer , admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship . He says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines . But when I ask whether they have been Russian , he replies nervously : &quot; I wouldn &apos;t want to comment on that , &quot; before adding : &quot; In general , we &apos;re always on the lookout . &quot; Nato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines , let alone the movements of any potential enemy . But this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia &apos;s increasing military strength . While many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities , Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his . Russia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters . Earlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the &quot; quiet@@ est submarine in the world . &quot; Peter Roberts , a former Royal Navy officer , and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank R@@ US@@ I , says it now leads the world in submarine development . He describes them as techn@@ ologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled . They are , he says , the &quot; quiet@@ est and most challenging adversary in the world . &quot; When out on patrol they can go undetected for months at a time . Often the first time a Nato warship will be aware of their presence is when a per@@ is@@ cope briefly pops above the waves . They lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and &quot; finger@@ printing &quot; other nations &apos; submarines and warships . For this exercise , cur@@ iously named &quot; Dynam@@ ic Mon@@ goose , &quot; as well as the warships there are anti-@@ submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search . For the first time , a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean . Scientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpe@@ does scan the seabed . It is not always easy to distinguish between the ship@@ wrecks , whales , fish sho@@ als and rocky out@@ crops in the sea . Ryan Gold@@ ha@@ hn , scienti@@ st-@@ in-@@ charge at Nato &apos;s Centre for Maritime Research and Experim@@ entation , says the underwater robots , which appear on their monitors as Har@@ po and Grou@@ cho , have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise . They are cheaper to operate , take the person out of harm &apos;s way and can offer persistent surveillance . Under@@ water drones are for the future . But for now one of the most important assets in any nation &apos;s arm@@ oury to conduct anti-@@ submarine warfare is the long-range maritime patrol aircraft . These are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean . For this exercise , the top cover is being provided by a French Atlan@@ tique maritime patrol aircraft . Inside in a dark@@ ened cabin , half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below . Britain no longer has any of its own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK &apos;s defences . Several times over the past year Britain has had to call on its Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain &apos;s waters . R@@ US@@ I &apos;s Mr Roberts says it is a &quot; key vulnerability . &quot; He says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft , that used to be provided by the Nim@@ rod , means

S-199	In his regular BBC Sport column , football pundit Robbie Savage looks at why Liverpool look a long way off repeating last season &apos;s title challenge , how they should line up against Chelsea and the physical and mental battle Steven Gerrard faces to secure a long-term future with the Reds . It is only six months since Steven Gerrard &apos;s slip helped the Blues clinch a famous win on Merseyside that derailed Liverpool &apos;s title bid . Back then , at the end of April , the title was in the Reds &apos; grasp . This weekend , I think we will see again how far away they are from mounting another title challenge . They are miles away from the level required for that , and will have to improve and work hard just to get in the top four . If they manage it , then securing back-to-back seasons in the Champions League should be seen as success for Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers . But not all their fans see it that way . I had some unhappy Reds supporters calling me up on 60@@ 6 on BBC Radio 5 live last weekend to give their manager stick . Part of Liverpool &apos;s problem is that they over@@ achieved massively last season , which has raised expectations un@@ realistically . That is not Rodgers &apos; fault . Where he can be questioned is in the transfer market , especially up front . Between them Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge scored 52 of Liverpool &apos;s 101 Premier League goals last season . With Suarez sold and Sturridge playing only three out of 10 league games so far this season because of injury , Rodgers has lost a lot of goals from his line-up . But he has had money to spend and I do not think he has bought the right strikers to fit his system . Looking at Rodgers &apos; options up front for Saturday , Mario Balotelli , Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini are his three available front men , and the bottom line is that they are not good enough . It is not just that they do not look like scoring . There is a big difference in their work-rate compared to what Suarez and Sturridge gave the team . That means Liverpool are not starting games with the same intensity they did last season , or pressing teams high up the pitch to force them into mistakes . Doing that in 2013-14 Liverpool scored 59 first-half goals , 13 more than any other team , and scored in the first half of 34 out of 38 league matches - again the most in the top flight . In their first 10 games of this campaign , they have only managed a total of four goals before half-time , in three different matches . Instead of being on the front foot , they are having to chase games . They look pedestrian and that is not just the centre-forward &apos;s fault . When I have watched them , no matter what formation they play , they do not seem to have any runners going past their striker from midfield . Again , last season that used to happen all the time , but I was at St James &apos; Park last weekend to co-@@ comment@@ ate on their defeat by Newcastle , and the only player to run beyond Balotelli in the first half was Gerrard , who did it once . Another problem is set-pieces . Liverpool were lethal from them last year , scoring with more than any other top-flight team . More than a third of their goals in 2013-14 came from corners or free-kicks , at a rate of almost one a game . That has dropped off dramatically . Sadly for Rodgers , seeing the goals drying up is not his only problem . Liverpool &apos;s defence was seen as their weakest link last season and , despite trying several different combinations , he did not get it right . From Mamadou Sakho for £ 18m in 2013 to Dejan Lovren for £ 20m this summer , Rodgers has thrown a lot of money at the problem but is still trying to find an answer . They still look all over the place at the back . St@@ atisti@@ cally , they are no worse defensively than last season - but they are also no better . Liverpool play and complete as many passes as before , and also keep as much possession . But with them no longer being able to out@@ score the opposition , it is no surprise their results have been affected . What Liverpool lack at the back is a leader , and their goalkeeper does not give them much help there . Simon Mignolet is clearly an excellent shot@@ -@@ stopper but I don &apos;t see him coming off his line enough , or commanding his box . Rodgers tried three at the back against the Magpies , but I cannot see him doing the same against Chelsea . He was criticised for resting players against Real Madrid on Tuesday but I agreed with him for doing it . Liverpool can still qualify for the knockout stages in Europe if they win their last two games in Group B and their weakened team actually did better against Real in Spain than the full-@@ strength side he picked at home . Now he has to decide who to play against Chelsea , but whoever he picks , Liverpool will need to show a huge improvement on their recent displays . My team to face Liverpool : Mignolet , Johnson , Skrtel , Toure , Moreno , Can , Gerrard , Sterling , Coutinho , Lallana , Borini . For me , Lovren is the big signing who makes way , with Kolo Toure keeping his place after doing well at the Bernabeu . It is a big call to drop Lovren when Rodgers has spent so much money on him , but he has just not been

Minister of State Carlos F@@ eij@@ o told reporters in the capital , Lu@@ anda , that a decision had been made instead to insert special clauses about internet crimes into the new penal code currently under revision . But many believe pressure from civil society and local journalists , who had strongly opposed the legislation claiming that it was &quot; tot@@ alitarian &quot; and violated basic freedom of expression , played a role in the decision to abandon the law . US-based lobby group Human Rights Watch said the legislation would have &quot; undercut both freedom of expression and information , and posed a severe threat to independent media , whistle-@@ blowers , and investigative journalism . &quot; With most of Angola &apos;s traditional media controlled by the state , or owned by government ministers and their business associates , there is little free debate in the newspapers or on television and radio . Opposition parties are rarely afforded column inches or air time , while government and presidential activities are covered in minute detail and nearly always with a positive spin . Civil society and opposition groups have therefore turned to the internet , even though only 1 % of Ang@@ ol@@ ans have access to the web , to hold their debates and share information through blogs and social networking sites . In recent months , several anti-government marches have been organised and promoted through Facebook , where there are pages dedicated to opposing the president of nearly 32 years , Jose Eduardo dos Santos . There , people make comments they would not dare speak out loud in public . Ang@@ ol@@ ans living in the diaspora have also been busy online , creating websites to rally support for regime change , and there have been several solidarity protest events held in South Africa , the UK and Belgium . Many are growing weary of the current regime and want more to be done to share the country &apos;s oil wealth among the majority , two thirds of whom still live in poverty and many without access to water or electricity . The introduction of a special internet law was seen as a deliberate attempt to quash the online discussion that was fuelling this unrest . In an un@@ characteristically emotional speech last month , President dos Santos lashed out at social media sites , saying they were being used to &quot; insult , denig@@ rate and provoke uproar and confusion . &quot; Officially the government stuck to its position that the technology legislation was needed to curb crimes such as child pornography , hacking and online financial fraud . The editor of the private weekly newspaper Ang@@ ol@@ ense , Suz@@ ana Mendes , who was among the journalists who publicly voiced concerns about the law , welcomed its withdrawal . &quot; The fact that the bill has been cancelled is important , because if it had been approved , it would have endangered our fundamental rights to inform and be informed , &quot; she told the BBC . Siz@@ al@@ t@@ ina Cut@@ aia , from the Ang@@ olan office of the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa ( Os@@ isa ) , which also opposed the bill , said they were pleased the government had backed down . &quot; This is definitely a victory for us and it is encouraging that we were able to get our message across . &quot; she said . However , civil society celebrations around the scrapping of the legislation were short-lived after a number of activists were arrested on Wednesday for taking part in an anti-@@ poverty demonstration in Lu@@ anda . Organised via Facebook by a group calling itself the Revolutionary Movement of Social Inter@@ vention ( MR@@ IS ) , the protest was due to take place at lunchtime . But following the arrest of MR@@ IS leader Luis Bernardo , allegedly detained while putting up posters near his home in the district of Caz@@ enga , only a few dozen people gathered in the city square . According to reports , between 15 and 20 people were detained , among them a journalist and a representative from Os@@ isa who had been trying to film the arrests . They were later released and rejoined the protest , which at its height numbered around 100 people . A spokesman for Lu@@ anda &apos;s provincial government told state media that the youth involved , who claimed they had authorisation to stage the protest , had acted &quot; criminally &quot; and the police force was within its rights to respond . &quot; What the government needs to realise is that the more they repres@@ s people , the more they will want to demonstrate , &quot; Ms Cut@@ aia said . Although small in size and number , protests like these are a relatively new phenomenon in Angola where few have dared to question the authority of President Dos Santos and his ruling MP@@ LA . &quot; The people leading these protests are young and they don &apos;t have as much to lose . They were born after independence

S-366	But VR can also be embedded in reality to give people more understanding of the world around them . Increasingly it is being used as a tool by journalists , teachers , healthcare workers and retailers . The BBC took a look at a few of the more unexpected uses of the technology . Surve@@ ys suggest that while 99 % of people have heard of autism , only 16 % really understand what it means . In the UK , more than a quarter of autistic people have been asked to leave a public place , such as a restaurant . In order to address this , the UK &apos;s National Au@@ tistic Society made a VR film this summer to show people what it was like to live with the condition . The film takes viewers on a journey with a young , autistic boy as he walks around a shopping centre . They can experience the sensory over@@ load he experiences as he walks around . Mark L@@ ever , chief executive of the National Au@@ tistic Society , says he hopes the film will &quot; help the public understand a little more about autism . &quot; The film , along with Samsung Gear headsets , was taken on tour around UK shopping centres this summer and the charity is also putting together a pack for schools to teach their students about autism . The film is available via an app and can be viewed on YouTube . Alzheimer &apos;s Research UK also released a VR film this summer , intended to put the public in the shoes of someone with dementia . A Walk Through Dementia aimed to show how everyday tasks such as making a cup of tea can be a challenge for someone with the condition . Virtual me@@ at@@ balls Virtual reality is becoming a common tool for people wanting to sell something . Estate agents use it to offer customers virtual walks from potential properties while Westfield shopping centre is using VR headsets to show off the latest fashion collections . In April , furniture retailer Ikea launched an app that placed users in a fully fur@@ nished kitchen . Users could change the colours of the units and walk around the space . The app was available through Steam , using the HTC Vive . Gam@@ ers are , said Ikea &apos;s In@@ grid Fran@@ ov , &quot; not a typical Ikea customer &quot; but the retailer was amazed by the reaction . &quot; In one month we had more downloads than we had expected for the whole six-@@ months trial and people were asking for more kitchen action , &quot; she told delegates at the recent VR &amp; AR World Forum in London . &quot; And what they wanted was me@@ at@@ ball , &quot; she said . Me@@ at@@ balls are perhaps the most famous dish in Ikea &apos;s restaurants . When me@@ at@@ balls were added to the kitchen , one user told the firm : &quot; I want you all to know that I have just spent 44 minutes throwing me@@ at@@ balls around a virtual kitchen and I loved every second of it . &quot; &quot; This is really talking to customers , &quot; said Ms Fran@@ ov . Now the retailer is considering rolling out the VR tool in stores to help customers better envisage how a kitchen design might look . Healthcare has become one of the big adop@@ ters of VR - using it both as teaching aid and to treat phob@@ ias . Sur@@ geon Dr Sha@@ fi Ahmed became one of the first to offer a live virtual surgery experience in April 2016 at the Royal London hospital . Some 5,000 people in 14 countries tuned in to watch the operation to remove a tumour . Now the start-up he co-founded , Medical Real@@ ities , is launching Virtual Sur@@ geon as a product , hoping that such surgery can reduce the cost of training doctors , reach a much wider audience and ultimately &quot; democrati@@ se medicine . &quot; Meanwhile , in the US , VR has been used to help soldiers deal with post-traumatic stress disorder and for ar@@ ach@@ no@@ phob@@ ics to overcome their fear of spiders . In one study , 23 people were encouraged to approach a virtual spider and by the end of the experiment , 83 % showed significant improvement in how they could tolerate the situation . In September 2015 , Google launched Ex@@ pe@@ ditions , a program designed to take thousands of school children around the world on a virtual trip - from the Great Barrier Reef to Mars . The kit , which comprises a Google cardboard headset and an app , has just been launched in the UK . Most pupils have enjoyed the experience although one Year 3 student told the Times Educational Supplement that they &quot; were a bit scared of heights so if it could just be on the ground then that would be an improvement for me . &quot; Marcus Storm is the founder of VR start-up Ev@@ an@@ escent Studios and he is developing a VR app that he hopes will be used in classrooms to improve language skills . The app is currently being trialled at Imperial College , with Mandarin as a pilot language . Users can watch Chinese people having conversations and visit Chinese landmarks such as the Great Wall . Mr Storm is enthusiastic about how VR can transform learning . &quot; We see a future where kids in history lessons are going back to revolutionary France and interacting with the people there , &quot; he said . It is a view echoed by Nicholas M@@ inter-@@ Green , president of Economist Films . &quot; It is bringing the joy to education . The biggest challenge has always been to engage and that is where VR can be a very powerful tool , &quot; he said . At VR &amp; AR World Forum in London , he spoke about how Chinese firm

S-112	Charlie Austin &apos;s six@@ th-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control , with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat . The hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans , but the mood inside the K@@ CO@@ M Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes . First , Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas &apos; low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster . Southampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goall@@ ine clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time . The win - Hull &apos;s first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-@@ game losing streak , although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break . Media playback is not supported on this device The best that could be said for the early loss of Hull &apos;s strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury . But his entrance from the bench following Keane &apos;s injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers &apos; top scorer - far from it . In@@ stantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch , having looked sluggish and un@@ inspired for 26 minutes before his introduction . The mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years . That run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Al@@ lam family &apos;s running of the club meant the K@@ CO@@ M Stadium had a th@@ read@@ bare look at kick-off , with an official attendance of just 17@@ ,7@@ 68 . Emp@@ ty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the raf@@ ters in the second and third tiers , and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players . Yet Snodgrass &apos; tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates , and his well-@@ taken 6@@ 1st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour . Southampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday , and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dam@@ pening their mood in the opening exchanges . Austin &apos;s early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies &apos; clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control , with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around , albeit with little cutting edge . Virgil van Dijk &apos;s looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead , and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-@@ fire double just after the hour mark . That was the spark for Claude Puel &apos;s men to push forward with greater urgency , but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire . The Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of El@@ din Jak@@ up@@ ovic coincided with Hull &apos;s slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down , and also kept out a Yoshida effort . Dawson then came to the rescue to hero@@ ically block from Austin , before Clucas produced a stunning goall@@ ine clearance deep in added time , the winger hacking the ball off the line , against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar . Hull City boss Mike Phelan , speaking to Match of the Day : &quot; I &apos;m really pleased for my players . We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries . The players are ecstatic . I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough . &quot; The players were a credit . Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent . Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight . He showed great character . &quot; Now that we have got three or four injuries , the international break has come at a good time for us . We will enjoy the next few days and start again . &quot; Media playback is not supported on this device Southampton manager Claude Puel , speaking to Match of the Day : &quot; We lacked concentration . We lost the rhythm of the game . It is important for the future that we learn from this situation . &quot; After a European game it is difficult to keep the same concentration . It is a good lesson for the future . &quot; We know all the teams are difficult to play and to play every three days is difficult . We have to learn this and keep the same concentration every game . &quot; Following the international break , Hull return to action with a trip to bottom side Sunderland on Saturday , 19 November ( 15 : 00 GMT ) , while on the same day Southampton play host to leaders Liverpool , also at 15 : 00 . Match ends , Hull City 2 , Southampton 1 . Second Half ends , Hull

S-115	Mr Duckenfield was match commander at the FA Cup semi-final when 96 Liverpool fans were fatally injured in a crush . Ex-@@ South Yorkshire Police ( SY@@ P ) Ch Insp Sir Norman Bet@@ tison , two officers , a solicitor and a Sheffield Wednesday club secretary also face charges . The Prime Minister said it would be a day of &quot; mixed emotions &quot; for families . Last year , new inquests into the disaster at the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest match , held at Sheffield Wednesday &apos;s ground , concluded the fans had been unlawfully killed . The inquests found that Liverpool supporters were not responsible for the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles . For legal reasons , Mr Duckenfield cannot be charged over the death of the 9@@ 6th victim , Tony Bland , as he died four years after the disaster , prosecutors said . The Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) must apply to the High Court to lift an order imposed after he was prosecuted privately in 1999 , which must be removed before he can be charged . An application will be made to the High Court in a matter of weeks and a senior judge will make a ruling in due course . The full list of individuals and charges are : The six men charged over Hillsborough Hillsborough : Criminal charges explained The defendants , other than Mr Duckenfield , will appear at Warrington Magistrates &apos; Court on 9 August . No organisation will face corporate charges and no-one from the ambulance service will be charged , said Sue Hemming , head of special crime and counter-terrorism at the CPS . She explained that Sheffield Wednesday is now a &quot; different company &quot; and , as it is not a successor organisation , is not criminally liable for any offences that might have been committed in 1989 . Â £ 5@@ 6.5m cost of Operation Resolve Â £ 42m cost of IPCC investigation 17,000 lines of inquiry by Operation Resolve 11,000 statements taken by Operation Resolve 190,000 documents reviewed by IPCC investigation 23,000 images reviewed by IPCC investigation The CPS brought charges following referrals from the Operation Resolve investigation into the causes of the disaster and the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) probe . Assistant Commissioner Rob Beck@@ ley , from Operation Resolve , said : &quot; Our inquiry looked at all aspects of the event , including the planning and the preparation for the game , the safety of the stadium and the response by the emergency services . &quot; The IPCC investigated the conduct of both SY@@ P and West Midlands Police ( W@@ MP ) in the days and weeks afterwards . Any decision regarding W@@ MP , which was brought in to carry out the original investigation into the conduct of SY@@ P officers , will be made at a later date . Ms Hemming made the announcement of the intended prosecutions to victims &apos; families at a private meeting in Warrington earlier . She said : &quot; Following our careful review of the evidence , in accordance with the code for Crown prosecutors , I have decided that there is sufficient evidence to charge six individuals with criminal offences . &quot; Criminal proceedings have now commenced and the defendants have a right to a fair trial . &quot; Campaigner Trevor Hicks , whose daughters Victoria , 15 , and Sarah , 19 , died in the disaster , said : &quot; There will be six people facing criminal charges who might not have done if we hadn &apos;t been resilient and all stuck together and fought this long fight . &quot; There are no winners in this , it doesn &apos;t bring anybody back . &quot; What it does do is send a message about accountability , as we keep saying , that nobody but nobody is above the law ; be it the police or anybody else . &quot; Chair@@ woman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group , Margaret Aspinall , whose son James , 18 , was killed , said : &quot; This is definitely the start of the end . &quot; I think everybody needs that , I think we all need peace from Hillsborough but we can never have peace until we &apos;ve got truth , justice , accountability . &quot; I think that &apos;s the time we &apos;ll all have peace . &quot; Barry Devon@@ side , whose son Christopher , 18 , was killed in the disaster , said : &quot; Everybody applauded when it was announced that the most senior police officer on that particular day will have charges presented to him . &quot; Evelyn McDonnell Mills , whose brother Peter McDonnell , 21 , died , said she was &quot; really happy , &quot; but sad that her brother who campaigned for years and died during the new inquests never got to see their conclusion . Pete Weather@@ by QC , who represents 22 of the victims &apos; families , said they had &quot; always known that accountability is the most difficult objective . &quot; &quot; They remain keen to see the criminal process properly pursued for those who have been charged and given that , the rights of the defendants should be respected . &quot; They do however hope that the memories of their loved ones and the integrity of the fans who attended Hillsborough will be respected during the process . &quot; BBC News profiles of all those who died At Prime Minister &apos;s Questions , Theresa May said : &quot; I know from working closely with the families when I was home secretary that this will be a day of mixed emotions for them . &quot; Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn offered a &quot; tribute to all of those that spent a great deal of time trying to ensure there was justice for those that died at Hillsborough . &quot; Dr Alan Billings , the South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner , said he hoped the start of criminal proceedings would &quot; lead to a

S-28	Sunderland &apos;s Giac@@ cher@@ ini slotted home in the first half after collecting Leonardo Bonucci &apos;s superb long pass . Southampton &apos;s Pelle sealed the win in injury time with an emphatic volley following an incisive break . Belgium were very disappointing , with Romelu Lukaku and Divock Origi wasteful in front of goal . Everton forward Lukaku curled over from the edge of the box with just the keeper to beat while Liverpool &apos;s Origi missed two opportunities to head his side level . Before the tournament began some pundits condemned this Italy squad for a lack of quality , and even coach Antonio Conte said : &quot; It isn &apos;t a good time for our football . &quot; The so@@ on-to-@@ be-@@ Chelsea boss added : &quot; It &apos;s important the squad has a good spirit . I work a lot at this . &quot; On the evidence of this game , that is not the only thing he has worked at . Italy &apos;s triumph was a result of superior organisation and discipline against 11 Belgian individuals who appear to possess , on paper at least , the greater talent . Both sides now face games against the Republic of Ireland and Sweden , who drew 1-1 in the Group E opener earlier on Monday . With 16 of 24 teams progressing from the group stage , Italy took a huge step towards advancing with victory against their lik@@ eli@@ est challengers . Italy have won this competition once , in 1968 , and finished runners-up twice - most recently in 2012 , when they were demolished 4-0 by Spain in the final . While the current Azzurri side went unbeaten through qualifying , winning seven of their 10 matches , they compare un@@ favourably with the side of four years ago , lacking the calm , creative brilliance of Andrea Pirlo in midfield and an attacking spearhead to adequately replace a faded Mario Balotelli . What they do have is a meticulous and tactically astute coach in the Chel@@ sea-@@ bound Conte and a stubborn Juvent@@ us-@@ centric defence . Such a foundation allowed them to limit and frustrate Belgium , leaving them vulnerable to one piece of ruthless counter-attacking brilliance - which Bonucci &apos;s 50-@@ yard , def@@ ence-@@ splitting pass and Giac@@ cher@@ ini &apos;s cool finish provided . The second half would have been more comfortable for Italy had a second goal been scored from an unmarked position by Pelle , who also had a second header saved by Thibaut Courtois after the break . However , Conte &apos;s imperious re@@ argu@@ ard held firm before Pelle volleyed home a neat chipped cross from Antonio Cand@@ reva . Despite only having qualified for one major tournament in the past 14 years , Belgium came to France as Europe &apos;s top-ranked side and one of the favourites to triumph in Paris on 10 July . Their status is built around the attacking potential and club-@@ forged reputation of individuals such as Kevin de Bruyne , Eden Hazard and Lukaku , as opposed to consistent evidence of a cohesive international team . However , the Red Devils did little to suggest they are ready to convert this promise into something concrete on the big stage . They were pedestrian in the first half , failing to get in behind the Italian backline , with De Bruyne particularly isolated . They upped the speed after the break but still struggled to test Gianluigi Buffon , with Lukaku curling over a good chance and substitute Origi spur@@ ning two glorious headed opportunities . Equally as worrying for Belgium was the performance of their defence . Already without the injured Vincent Kompany , they looked particularly vulnerable with Jan Vertonghen deployed at left-back instead of alongside his Tottenham colleague Toby Alderweireld in the centre . Italy coach Antonio Conte : &quot; What we demonstrated tonight is that there were two teams who played exciting football , with changes at both ends . It proves that nothing is already written in football , and it is on the field where you have to make your point . &quot; In a tournament like this , you need an al@@ ch@@ emy , of people who get on well together and the biggest satisfaction for me tonight is to see how happy they all were , also those on the bench . There &apos;s a very good spirit in this squad . &quot; Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois : &quot; Now we have to win the other two matches and be a better team . Italy outclassed us in organisation , and tactically they were the best team . &quot; BBC pundit and former Italy striker Gianluca Vi@@ all@@ i : &quot; I don &apos;t want to bra@@ g , but we were almost perfect . We dominated the game , we showed desire and commitment and we played like a team . We had a perfect game plan . &quot; BBC pundit and ex-England defender Rio Ferdinand : &quot; That was a perfect example of one playing like a team , the other like a group of individuals . What was so impressive is the way they can go from defence to attack so quickly . &quot; Italy face Sweden in Toulouse at 14 : 00 BST on Friday with Belgium taking on the Republic of Ireland in Bordeaux at 14 : 00 the following day . Match ends , Belgium 0 , Italy 2 . Second Half ends , Belgium 0 , Italy 2 . Goal ! Belgium 0 , Italy 2 . Graziano Pell@@ è ( Italy ) right footed shot from the centre of the box to the bottom left corner . Assisted by Antonio Cand@@ reva . Jan Vertonghen ( Belgium ) is shown the yellow card . Foul by Dries Mertens ( Belgium ) . Marco Par@@ olo ( Italy ) wins a free kick in the defensive half . Corner , Belgium . Conceded by Mat@@ tia De Sc@@ ig@@ lio . Attempt saved . Marco Par@@ olo

S-51	Craig Bryson gave the Rams an early lead when he struck from the edge of the area , before Thomas Ince curled in a stunning effort to double the lead . Shortly after Bryson hit the crossbar , Darren Bent added a third when he headed home from close range . Ipswich struggled for clear-cut chances , while Derby missed several . Ince , whose earlier effort came after he drifted in from the right to score his 11th goal of the season , could only hit the post from a low cross by Bent in the second half . Ipswich keeper Bartosz Bial@@ kowski also made smart saves from both Bent and Jacob Butterfield . The hosts had a late penalty appeal when Grant Ward went down in the area , shortly before Ki@@ effer Moore &apos;s shot was deflected wide on his home debut . The result leaves the hosts with just one win from their last seven games , a run which included being knocked out of the FA Cup by non-league Lincoln City . There was further bad news for McCarthy &apos;s men , with influential forward Tom Lawrence replaced at half-time because of injury . Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy : &quot; It looked like an ordinary start from both teams , but the first goal was far too easy for me , as was the second . &quot; We &apos;d had a bit of a rally just before the third goal , when we should have scored from a corner kick , but then we give the ball away and it ends up in the net . &quot; It &apos;s quite clearly a foul in the build-up , which is not irrelevant because at 2-0 we could maybe get back in it , but 3-0 has put the game to bed . &quot; Derby manager Steve McClaren : &quot; We should have scored more goals , but you can &apos;t have everything . I thought we were great in the first half - we &apos;ve been so disappointed with our starts over recent games . &quot; There were some tremendous performances and to come here and win 3-0 means the credit has to go to the players . &quot; The most important thing in the second half was not to be complacent , keep a clean sheet and take home the three points . &quot; Match ends , Ipswich Town 0 , Derby County 3 .

S-185	The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) says the full evacuation of civilians and rebels is likely to take several days . Government forces , backed by Russian allies , took nearly all remaining rebel-held parts of Aleppo this week . It represents a major victory for President Bashar al-Assad . He hailed the &quot; liberation &quot; of Aleppo and said history was being made . Global solidarity over Aleppo How Srebrenica &apos;s survivors view Aleppo What &apos;s happening in Aleppo ? What happens next ? The evacuation of civilians , rebels and their families had been due to take place on Wednesday but an earlier ceasefire deal collapsed . &quot; Some 3,000 civilians and more than 40 wounded , including children , were brought out , &quot; the head of the ICRC in Syria , Marianne G@@ asser , said after two convoys left . &quot; No-one knows how many people are left in the east , and the evacuation could take days , &quot; she added . The evacuees are being transferred to rebel-held areas in neighbouring Idlib province . US Secretary of State John Kerry meanwhile accused Syrian leaders of carrying out &quot; nothing short of a massacre &quot; in Aleppo and urged them to return to peace talks in Geneva . &quot; The only remaining question is whether the Syrian regime , with Russia &apos;s support , is willing to go to Geneva prepared to negotiate constructively , and whether or not they &apos;re willing to stop this slaughter of their own people , &quot; he said in Washington . John Kerry expressed moral outrage at the fate of Aleppo and he stressed that the Syrian regime was responsible for the failure of a year &apos;s worth of US-@@ Russian negotiations aimed at a nationwide ceasefire and peace talks . But he didn &apos;t offer any new plan to end the conflict . Nor did he accept that the fall of Aleppo was also due to a failure of US diplomatic strategy . &quot; You can &apos;t make someone do something through diplomacy that they &apos;re not prepared to negotiate , &quot; he told me . Critics in Washington , though , have slammed the Obama administration for refusing to back that diplomacy with the threat of credible force , giving Mr Kerry very little to work with other than good faith . Some have fa@@ ulted the secretary of state for having too much faith in Russia &apos;s willingness for a deal - &quot; delusional diplomacy , &quot; the Washington Post called it . Mr Kerry made clear he would continue his tireless efforts to reach a peace deal . But the fall of Aleppo almost certainly means he has run out of time to do so in the wan@@ ing weeks of this administration , and the Syria crisis will be passed on to the next one . Syrian state media said rebels had blown up their ammunition dumps and destroyed documents before leaving the city . A statement from the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of Op@@ posing S@@ ides in Syria , part of Russia &apos;s ministry of defence , said the Syrian authorities had guaranteed the safety of all members of the armed groups who decided to leave Aleppo . The rebels confirmed a fresh ceasefire had come into effect at 03 : 00 GMT and that a new deal had been agreed . As operations began , an ambulance service official in eastern Aleppo said that one convoy of ambulances had been shot at , with three people injured . The White Hel@@ mets civil defence group tweeted that one senior volunteer had been shot and injured by a sniper while clearing an evacuation route for ambulances . Buses and ambulances are taking the injured , civilians and rebel fighters to the neighbouring province of Idlib , most of which is controlled by a powerful rebel alliance that includes the jihadist group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham . The buses left Aleppo via the road through the government-controlled south-western district of Ram@@ ousse@@ h , heading towards the nearby rebel-held towns of Khan Tou@@ man and Khan al-@@ As@@ al . The chief of the Russian military &apos;s General Staff , Gen Val@@ ery Ger@@ asi@@ mo@@ v , told a news briefing : &quot; A humanitarian corridor has been created for the evacuation of militants . &quot; &quot; This corridor is 21@@ km long , &quot; he said , adding , &quot; 6km lie across Aleppo &apos;s territories controlled by government troops and another 15km through territories in the hands of illegal armed groups . &quot; Turkey , which helped to broker the evacuation , is preparing to receive some of the most vulnerable civilians , President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said . In a televised address , he said Turkey would take &quot; children , elders , those who are really in difficult conditions . &quot; The head of the Turkish Red Crescent , Ker@@ em Kin@@ ik , told reporters that the wounded would be the first to be transferred . UN Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said about 50,000 people were still trapped and he warned that moving those evacuated to Idlib might not prove much safer . &quot; If there is no political agreement and a ceasefire , Idlib will become the next Aleppo , &quot; he told reporters in Paris . The 50,000 are said to include about 4,000 fighters and about 10,000 of their family members . Aleppo &apos;s besieged residents have faced weeks of bombardment and chronic food and fuel shortages . Russian Lt Gen Viktor Po@@ zni@@ kh@@ ir said on Thursday that , with the evacuation , the Syrian armed forces had almost finished their operations in Aleppo . Fighting has raged there for four years . In October , President Assad said victory in Aleppo would be &quot; the springboard ... to liberate other areas from terrorists , &quot; a term the government uses to describe all rebel fighters . He singled out Idlib province , west of Aleppo , that is

S-207	Media playback is not supported on this device The Sweden striker , who is out of contract after four years at Paris St-Germain , could follow former manager Jose Mourinho to Old Trafford . Football finance expert Rob Wilson says the 34-year-old would be United &apos;s most market@@ able player since Cristiano Ronaldo , and linking up with the three-time European champions would be a &quot; match made in heaven . &quot; Wilson says Ibrahimovic &apos;s shirt sales alone would help cover the cost of finishing fifth in the Premier League this season and missing out on the riches of playing in Europe &apos;s elite competition , worth up to £ 50m . &quot; It would not surprise me if Zlatan sold more shirts than Ronaldo or Lionel Messi , &quot; Wilson , a lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University , told BBC Sport . &quot; The cost of missing out on the Champions League is £ 30-@@ 50m . Zlatan will help plug that gap significantly with the number of shirts shifted by United . &quot; It is a match made in heaven . The football club is commercially so aware who will exploit every commercial opportunity . &quot; To them , they are signing a player who understands commercial endorsements and behaves in a way that allows him to maximise them . &quot; Put that together and you get the holy gra@@ il stakes of shirt sales , and stacks of corporate sponsorship . &quot; Zlatan is also the sort of player who brings ad hoc ticket buyers to a match , even if it is the Europa League or League Cup . &quot; It is matching the world &apos;s biggest sporting brands with one of the most market@@ able players , who has cult following , plus it is his career swan@@ song . &quot; If you marry that with Manchester United , he will probably shift more shirts in the next year than any player in the squad because of the superstar status that he has . &quot; Wilson claimed that Ibrahimovic could become the face of Manchester United . &quot; Zlatan has a global profile , and global appeal , &quot; he said . &quot; Fans will buy shirts with Ibrahimovic on the back in Africa , South East Asia - markets United had a foothold in but not the leverage . &quot; Only a few select few players can do that : Gareth Bale , Neymar , Lionel Messi and Ronaldo . &quot; If they are the off-@@ pitch benefits of signing Ibrahimovic , what else will the enigmatic Swede bring to Old Trafford and the Premier League ? Since making his debut for his hometown club of Malmo in 1999 , Ibrahimovic has played for some of Europe &apos;s biggest clubs : Ajax , Juventus , Inter Milan , Barcelona , AC Milan and PSG , commanding transfer fees of more than £ 120m . He has scored 3@@ 92 goals in 6@@ 77 games and last season was his most prolific , with 50 goals in 51 matches - a record for PSG - while his 38 league goals is also a club record . Media playback is not supported on this device Ibrahimovic does not do ordinary goals . He scored four against England in a friendly in 2012 , including an amazing overhead kick and then there are the free-kicks , long-range goals , back-@@ heels , fl@@ icks and scor@@ p@@ ion goals . Manchester United &apos;s FA Cup victory on Saturday was their first trophy since the Premier League title in 2013 , when Sir Alex Ferguson retired . But Ibrahimovic is used to regular success and has won 12 trophies in four seasons at PSG , including the domestic quadruple twice . While he may not have the same Ballon d &apos;Or collection as Messi or Ronaldo , at least Ibrahimovic can console himself with being - beyond doubt - the best player in Sweden . The striker has won a record 10 Gul@@ d@@ bol@@ len ( Golden Ball ) , the award given to the best male footballer in his home country . Ibrahimovic is one of the most quot@@ able figures in world football . Here are just a few examples : Johanna Fr@@ and@@ en , international football correspondent for Swedish newspaper Af@@ ton@@ bl@@ ad@@ et , has spent four years in Paris reporting on Ibrahimovic . &quot; He will play up to that image that people had of him , &quot; Fr@@ and@@ en told BBC Sport . &quot; When he says these things there is still a smile behind it , but for the last 15 years he has had so many people telling him how good he is that I think he does believe all of it . &quot; Ibrahimovic has always enjoyed a spi@@ ky relationship with the media and his critics . In 2015 , after the semi-final of the French League Cup , he ordered his team-mates not to talk to journalists . When questioned why , he said : &quot; Because I am the boss . &quot; &quot; Only God knows &quot; was Ibrahimovic &apos;s answer when quizzed by a journalist about Sweden &apos;s chances against Portugal in the 2014 World Cup play-offs . &quot; Well , it &apos;s a bit hard to ask him , &quot; the reporter said , to which the player replied : &quot; You &apos;re talking to him now . &quot; On another occasion , he was forced to apologise for describing France in not so ende@@ aring terms . &quot; There will be a clash &#91; with the media &#93; , &quot; said Fr@@ and@@ en . &quot; He will not hold back . He is not scared by the media ; he will tell the journalists what he thinks . &quot; You expect if there is any discontent it will leak out . &quot; He can handle the pressure , but he keeps his private life private , he does not invite the press in and his partner Helena Se@@ ger will

S-213	Liam Craig swept home Steven MacLean &apos;s delivery in with 14 minutes gone . ICT captain Gary Warren was dismissed for two boo@@ kable offences in quick succession after the break , leading to Murray Davidson firing in a second . Danny Swanson broke neatly into the box and killed off Caley Thistle in the final 10 minutes with a low finish . Inverness , now propping up the league table , have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premiership . Their re@@ argu@@ ard were all lured to the ball for the opening goal . Good play from MacLean drew in a pos@@ se of defenders before he played in Craig to def@@ tly finish from the edge of the box . When skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness . His first yellow was for persistent fouling . His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him . The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead . Injuries have not helped Caley Thistle &apos;s cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence . St Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match . Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals . It was better in the first half . Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal . Overall Inverness looked too@@ thless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves . There was a sw@@ agger about Wright &apos;s side after they opened the scoring , but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead . They might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge . It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away . St Johnstone deserved another goal , though , and it came after Warren &apos;s dismissal , Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ric@@ o@@ cheted free-kick . Swanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time , as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory . St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright : &quot; We started on the front foot , got the goal , then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit . Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems . &quot; Our ach@@ illes heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays , and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well . &quot; Swanson &apos;s goal is a good , quality goal , and we probably could &apos;ve scored more when they went down to 10 . I &apos;m pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet . &quot; Inverness CT manager Richie Foran : &quot; We got what we deserved . We &apos;ve gone from one of our best performances of the season ( against Dundee ) to probably our worst . It &apos;s very disappointing . Talk about being inconsistent - that &apos;s sums us up this season . &quot; You &apos;re in there before games trying to motivate them and they &apos;re talking the talk , all the cl@@ ich@@ és , and they &apos;re going out there and not walking the walk . Go do your talking on the park - we didn &apos;t today . &quot; I can &apos;t be too harsh on the lads , their attitude is wonderful day in , day out , but you get paid to perform in the match and we &apos;ve not performed over the last three or four games . &quot; But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we &apos;ve got too many attack@@ -minded players , we &apos;re right up there on the goal charts , but we &apos;re worse off on goals against , so we need more defen@@ si@@ ve-@@ minded players and I &apos;ll go and get them ( in January ) .

S-242	On Thursday , an investment manager and hairdresser will challenge the right of the government to start the process of withdrawing the UK from the EU without a vote in Parliament . Lawyers will question whether Prime Minister Theresa May is entitled to act unilaterally , using powers left over from the days of medieval mon@@ archs . It could end up - in theory - with Parliament being given a means to stop Brexit . So as constitutional rows go , it is box office stuff . Or as professor of public law at Cambridge University , Mark Elliott , puts it : &quot; I don &apos;t rule out the possibility of the government losing the case . &quot; Leading the fight against the government is Gina Miller , who runs an investment firm in London , SC@@ M Private . She argues that only Parliament can make a decision that leads to the loss of her &quot; rights &quot; under EU law . She is confident she has a strong case and is und@@ aun@@ ted by criticism . &quot; I do not back away from a fight , &quot; she says . &quot; I &apos;m very vocal about things and I &apos;m no stranger to making enemies . &quot; She is joined by London-based Spanish hairdresser Deir Dos Santos and the People &apos;s Challenge group , set up by Grahame Pig@@ ney and backed by a crowd-funding campaign . Also weighing into the case against the government is the group , Fair Deal for Exp@@ ats . Around two million British citizens are believed to live and work in other EU countries . The Brexit terms have not been decided but expats - some of whom were barred from voting in the referendum - fear potential repatriation and are worried about the impact on their jobs and homes as well as the ramifications for healthcare , their children &apos;s schooling and pensions . Three London law firms - Mish@@ con de Re@@ ya , Edwin Coe and B@@ ind@@ mans - have agreed to take up the case . Croft Solicitors is representing the expats . Super@@ star of the bar &quot; Lord P@@ ann@@ ick QC - also an independent member of the House of Lords - will be arguing Gina Miller &apos;s case while the government is turning to an old favourite , James Eadie QC . Attorney General Jeremy Wright QC , the government &apos;s legal adviser , will also play a big role . He said : &quot; There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU , no attempts to re-@@ join it through the back door , and no second referendum . &quot; We do not believe this case has legal merit . The result should be respected and the government intends to do just that . &quot; In political terms , the UK is on course for departure from the EU . But as far as the law goes , nothing has changed . The UK remains a fully pa@@ id@@ -up member of the EU until it triggers Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon 2007 . The question at the heart of the row is : who should activate Article 50 ? The prime minister or Parliament ? During the referendum campaign , the then prime minister , David Cameron , said that in the event of a Leave vote he would activate Article 50 immediately . The government maintains that his successor Theresa May has the authority to do so , without a vote by MPs . That right - they say - is based on the Royal Pr@@ er@@ ogative - powers once held by kings and queens to do , essentially , what they wished . The use of prerogative powers in a modern parliamentary democracy is a curious corner of British law . Over centuries , power in the UK has been wre@@ sted away from dict@@ atorial mon@@ archs and handed to elected politicians . But government ministers have managed to cling on to a few of those reg@@ al powers , usually in international affairs . One such prerogative is the power to make and break treaties with other countries . The government &apos;s position is that triggering Article 50 is all about ending a treaty with other EU countries and so using prerogative powers in these circumstances is &quot; entirely consistent with standard constitutional practice . &quot; Critics will argue in the High Court that it is a bit more complicated than that . They say that acti@@ vating Article 50 effectively wi@@ pes out the European Communities Act 1972 , passed by Parliament and allowing EU law to apply in the UK . Lawyers opposing the government argue that the 1972 Act introduced a big constitutional change and gave British people new rights . It would be unlawful , they conclude , for a prime minister to use the Royal Pr@@ er@@ ogative to take away rights best@@ owed by Parliament . Grahame Pig@@ ney , from the People &apos;s Challenge , says the &quot; enforced removal &quot; of citizenship rights from 65 million people would be &quot; completely unprecedented &quot; in a modern democracy . &quot; I believe that , as Parliament has granted us these rights , it is for Parliament to decide when , how and under what circumstances they are taken away , &quot; he says . Lawyers working for Fair Deal for Exp@@ ats will be deploying similar legal arguments but using evidence to emphasise the human impact of Brexit . The chairman of Fair Deal for Exp@@ ats , John Shaw - who lives in France - has submitted a statement to the High Court saying the referendum result was a &quot; shock . &quot; He is currently undergoing cancer treatment in France . He states : &quot; If my right to access healthcare is either taken away , or compromised materially such that I am not able to rely upon it in the same way as French nationals , I would be unlikely to receive

S-20	This is the full statement to the inquests from his niece , Ms Natalie Tennant , on behalf of his brother , Peter Cop@@ oc : Stephen Paul Cop@@ oc was born on 1 August 1968 , and was aged 20 years when he died at Hillsborough . Stephen was the baby of our family , and the apple of our Mum &apos;s eye . Our family consisted of Mum and Dad , I , Peter , my sister Angela and then our Stephen . I was 10 years old when Stephen was born . Angela was just seven years old . Our Dad took us to the hospital , so that we could meet our new baby brother . Mum and Dad said that Angela and I could name him , and we did . Fin@@ anci@@ ally , we had little , but our parents , Agnes and Harold , made sure that there was lots of love in our house . Stephen was such a joy to all of us . Mum and Dad only received good reports from Stephen &apos;s school regarding his conduct and application to his lessons . Profiles of all those who died Stephen &apos;s personality was such that people warmed to him instantly as he had an easy way with him . He was popular with teachers and made friends , having the ability to also keep friends . The friends that he made when he was small were still his close friends when he died on that awful day . When we moved from Gar@@ ston to our new house in Spe@@ ke , Stephen had no problems adapting to the new environment , getting to know our new neighbours and making friends in an effor@@ tless and un@@ complicated way . I started work at 17 . There was a shop in Gar@@ ston called Smiths that sold everything . It &apos;s gone now . I bought Stephen a train set when I got paid . He was about nine at the time and wanted one . As Angela and I were so much older than him , we kind of spoilt him , as he was such a lo@@ vable kid . I remember us both setting up the train set together and the joy Stephen got playing with it . He was so careful about his toys . When he finished playing with the train set , he would put it away neatly . He minded his toys . He used to follow Angela everywhere , even if she was going out to meet friends he would follow her and she would complain to Mum and Dad about having to bring 11 him . However , one day someone told Angela that there was an accident on the road and that Stephen was hurt . Angela ran down the cin@@ der path near our home towards the school crying . When she got there , she was told he had not waited for the l@@ olli@@ pop lady and got a bump from a car . He was physically fine , but Angela was sob@@ bing and so distressed at the thought that Stephen was hurt . Angela was so good to Stephen and minded him throughout his childhood . All her friends knew him well because he was like her shadow . Stephen started to take an interest in birds when he was about 12 years old . He started to study them and could tell you the name of most birds as well as their eggs . It was also around this time that he became interested in fishing . We had cousins that were avid fishermen and they took him along to Spe@@ ke Hall , which is a rural setting in a National Trust estate right in the middle of Liverpool . He just loved fishing there and knew all about the fish that lived in the waters there . He seldom , if ever , brought fish home to Mum and Dad . It was a joke in our house about Stephen catching fish , but he preferred to put the fish back into the water . We think it was the birds and the fishing that started Stephen wanted to work out of doors . He appreciated being outdoors . He finished school at 16 years of age and studied for his City and Guil@@ ds in Bot@@ any and Hor@@ ticul@@ ture . He could name any flower and plant and was perfectly at home with nature . He applied for and got a job with the Liverpool Parks and Gardens based in Calder@@ stones Park . He treasured his job and became a gardener at Sud@@ ley Hall in Mos@@ sley Hill . He loved his work , the people he worked with , he enjoyed meeting all the visitors and telling them about the gardens . When Stephen was about 15 years old , he met his girlfriend Jackie . They were very much in love and were engaged to be married when he died . Stephen knew what he wanted from life . He was very close to our Mum and his main ambition in life was to save enough money to buy our parents a house . He did not want them living in rented accommodation . He was mature and sensible for his age . He took out insurance policies in case anything happened to him , as he wanted our parents to have some money . He was very caring to his ni@@ eces and nephews . When Angela &apos;s marriage broke down and she was on her own with her two children , Sean and Carla , Stephen with his girlfriend Jackie would baby@@ sit and play with the children , keeping them amused for hours . He could have been out with his mates but knew that Angela needed time alone and his family always came first with him . Stephen , of course , loved football . His love of football and of Liverpool came

S-66	She had been contemplating the 50 hours she &apos;d just spent crushed inside a tiny cupboard , hidden beneath a pile of clothes , with nothing but a bottle of body l@@ otion to try to qu@@ en@@ ch a raging thirst . The sound of her friends being but@@ chered in the courtyard outside echoed in her ears . Cynthia , a 19-year-old student at Garissa &apos;s teacher training college on the edge of town , spoke with the studied pol@@ it@@ eness that I &apos;ve encountered repeatedly in the past few days in this isolated town , on the hot , dry plains that stretch towards and over the seemingly not@@ ional border that separates Kenya from Somalia . There have been plenty of tears from the survivors of Thursday &apos;s killings . But when confronted by a foreign journalist , each student I met seemed too anxious to reach - more so than in any other similar situation I can remember - for some appro@@ xim@@ ation of composure . &quot; I &apos;m fine , thanks . &quot; &quot; Everything is fine now . &quot; &quot; Thank you for asking . &quot; I am very wary of reading too much into such things . But I found their pol@@ it@@ eness increasingly unbearable . I couldn &apos;t shake off the sense that it was somehow linked to the horrors they &apos;d just endured ; that it was a lingering echo of the instinctive , terror@@ -@@ driven restraint - a num@@ bed obe@@ dience borne out of the pu@@ rest desperation - that had allowed four gunmen to spend hours si@@ fting , separating , ta@@ unting and but@@ ch@@ ering a huge crowd of young men and women . These feel like bewil@@ dering times for Kenya . Not so much in Garissa . In this poor town on the banks of the slow , brown T@@ ana river , the local ethnic Somali population is used to navigating the complexities of religion and identity . They are proud Kenyans , but occasionally feel like second-class citizens , suspected by every passing , bri@@ be-@@ hungry policeman of supporting the Islamist militants of al-Shabab across the border . But elsewhere , Kenya seems preoccupied by other matters ; by its own hectic development , its increasingly confident , assertive sense of itself as a modern , industrialised , tolerant nation - albeit one with deep levels of inequality . Al-Shabab - with its bombs , its medieval values , and blood-@@ cur@@ dling threats - feels not just out of place here , but baffling . Something on which to turn one &apos;s back . Perhaps that helps to explain why , despite the 2013 attack at Nairobi &apos;s Westgate mall , security in the capital remains noticeably lax . At Wilson airport this week , a porter help@@ fully offered to smuggle my bag on to a plane without going through the scanners . When I asked him why , he shrugged and said : &quot; Oh , I thought you were carrying guns . &quot; And yet you could argue that Kenya &apos;s leaders must have known all this was on the horizon . For two decades Kenya managed to live alongside one of the world &apos;s most anarch@@ ic countries . It took in vast numbers of Somali refugees , many of them lived in giant camps near the border , supported by the UN and international NGOs , and helping to stimulate the local economy . But Somalia &apos;s chaos stayed , for the most part , outside of Kenya . Then , in 2011 , the government &apos;s patience snapped - partly due to a series of kidnappings along Kenya &apos;s tou@@ ri@@ st-@@ dependent coast . Troops were sent into Somalia and Kenya &apos;s government quickly found itself nec@@ k-@@ deep in the murky world of clan politics and patronage , buffer zones , spher@@ es of influence , and the need strike deals with &quot; friendly &quot; war@@ lords . Since then , al-Shabab has lashed out repeatedly at Kenya . Reven@@ ge is part of it . But some would argue that the focus on Kenya is actually a sign of al-Shabab &apos;s current weakness , as it loses territory within Somalia to African Union forces and an increasingly confident central government , and seeks to project the illusion of strength elsewhere . Then there is the fact that al-Shabab is no longer a purely cross-border operation . It has established deep roots ( as President Uhuru Kenyatta acknowledged again on Saturday ) within Kenya - roots nourished by the activities of Kenya &apos;s heavy-handed security forces and by the growing sense of alienation felt by young men in marginalised communities along the Somali border and the coast . And then there is Greater Somalia . It is no secret - indeed it is enshrined in the five-@@ pointed star on the national flag - that Somalis have always cherished the idea of one day uniting all the ethnic Somali regions taken from it at the end of the colonial era - in Ethiopia , Kenya and Djibouti , along with Somaliland - into one Greater Somalia stretching across the Horn of Africa . Al-Shabab may publicly esp@@ ouse a global jihadist agenda , but it too is motivated by deeply nation@@ alistic urges . By attacking non-@@ Muslim students in Garissa , the militants may well have been seeking - in their war@@ ped way - to promote the fortunes of Greater Somalia , by sewing divisions between ethnic Somalis and other Kenyans in the area . Not that there was any hint in Garissa this week , that the militants were succeeding . Quite the opposite . Yes , it was disappointing to see the way the surviving students were treated by the authorities here - forced to camp out for two days before being bus@@ sed out of town . Surely they deserved better than that . One suspects wealthier students , at a more prestigious college ,

S-290	The latest intake of Tory MPs is far and away the most Eurosceptic in the Conservative Party &apos;s history . Almost all of the pro-European &quot; big beasts &quot; of the Thatcher / Major years - men like Chris Patten and Michael Heseltine - are long gone from front-line politics . According to Tim Montgomerie , the as@@ sid@@ uous student of backbench opinion who writes for the website Conservative Home , a third of those now on the Conservative benches would like to see a fundamental renegotiation of the UK &apos;s relationship with Europe , and another third would like Britain to come out altogether . The estimate of more than a hundred outright &quot; with@@ dra@@ wal@@ ists &quot; - Conservatives who essentially believe in the European policy of the UK Independence Party - suggests many Tory MPs are being co@@ y about what they really believe . Only ten Conservative MPs have declared their position publicly , by joining the &quot; Better Off Out &quot; group , which campaigns openly for withdrawal . Today Euroscep@@ ticism is the iceberg of Tory politics ; only the top is visible , but a large and - for the leadership - possibly dangerous mass lies beneath the water . That impression is reinforced by the fact that two of the MPs I interviewed for BBC Radio 4 &apos;s Analysis would talk only on condition we concealed their identity . One of them told me that even though his views are , he believes , now &quot; mainstream &quot; in his party , he still sees support for EU withdrawal in Wil@@ dean terms as &quot; the love that dare not speak its name . &quot; The other complained of a &quot; sup@@ ine approach &quot; to Europe by the Party &apos;s leadership since it came into government . When the Conservatives were in opposition , David Cameron made a &quot; cast@@ -@@ iron guarantee &quot; that , should he be elected Prime Minister , he would hold a referendum on any EU Treaty that emerged , as &quot; no treaty should be ratified without consulting the British people in a referendum . &quot; The Lisbon treaty was ratified by all EU states before the 2010 general election , but critics maintain that David Cameron rene@@ ged on his promise . &quot; The collateral damage from that broken promise , &quot; our un-@@ nam@@ eable MP said , &quot; is a bit of a black cloud over the government even now . &quot; Could the government ship be heading towards a collision with the Eurosceptic iceberg ? There are signs of new currents of opinion on Europe swirling through the left of British politics too . Last year , during the Labour leadership campaign , Ed Balls questioned one of the principles at the heart of the EU and its single market , the free movement of labour . Mr Balls , now shadow chancellor , said he wanted to stop &quot; the practice where people can work in our country and send benefits back to their own countries . &quot; That theme has been picked up by Lord Glas@@ man , the driving force behind the Blue Labour movement - which aims to revitalise the party &apos;s traditional grassroots support - and an influential adviser to the Labour leader Ed Miliband . Maurice Glas@@ man argues against the current EU rules which , he says , encourage people in poorer member states to leave their families to work overseas , arguing the practice can de@@ press workers &apos; incomes in richer economies . He told Analysis he would be happy to make common cause with Tory Eurosceptics if he concluded it would advance his cause . All these factors suggest that Europe could soon occupy centre stage in British politics once again . And the crisis in the eurozone has offered a golden opportunity to those pushing the government to engage in debate about Europe . Douglas Carswell , Tory backbench MP for Clacton in Essex , and one of the small group of Better Off Out MPs , argues that the eurozone crisis has destroyed the economic case for EU membership : &quot; Far from joining a prosperous trading bloc , &quot; he says , &quot; we shackled ourselves to a corpse . We are now actually having to pay to prop up a zombie currency we didn &apos;t even join . &quot; But Mr Carswell appears to be in a minority - not so much in his views , as in his enthusiasm for making Europe a sali@@ ent issue at this stage of the current parliament . Tory memories of the bitter divisions of the past over Europe are still raw . There is also a widespread recognition among Eurosceptic Tories that economic recovery , not Europe , must be the government &apos;s priority . &quot; So long as Britain is in an economic crisis , &quot; says Tim Montgomerie , &quot; every Conservative MP knows that the focus must be on fixing that , and staying in coalition with the Liberal Democrats as a government of national unity . &quot; Analysis is on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 17 October 20 : 30 BST and Sunday 23 October at 21 : 30 BST Download the Analysis podcast Listen via the Radio 4 website Follow Analysis on Facebook Last month a group of more than a hundred Conservative MPs met in the Thatcher Room of the House of Commons to debate a European strategy . The meeting &apos;s convener , the young MP for Cam@@ borne , Red@@ ruth and Hay@@ le , and former Cameron aide George E@@ ustice , said the group would be looking for &quot; new thinking &quot; on Europe , not campaigning for a referendum on British withdrawal .

S-108	Media playback is not supported on this device E@@ motion . Drama . Exc@@ itement . Br@@ illi@@ ant football . No@@ ise . Colour . And all this even before Liverpool &apos;s Dejan Lovren rose high at the far post in front of The K@@ op in injury time to secure a 4-3 victory that will rank alongside the great dramas staged at this sporting theatre . It was played out to the backdrop of Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp &apos;s almost cra@@ zed touchline demeanour and the young coach who succeeded him at Borussia Dortmund , the gifted and wonderfully dignified Thomas Tuchel . Liverpool moved a step closer to earning a place in the Champions League by winning what some regard as Europe &apos;s second-@@ rate pot - not a label anyone was att@@ aching to it after this classic . Liverpool into last four after Euro thriller Istanbul 2005 win inspired Reds - Klopp Liverpool fan to name newborn son Dejan When Klopp was introduced as Liverpool manager as successor to sacked Brendan Rodgers in October , he revealed one of his priorities was to &quot; turn doubters into believers . &quot; And it was the transition from doubt to belief that was at the core of this remarkable Liverpool victory , both on the pitch and in the stands . If there was a trace of doubt this result would not have happened . In nine blistering minutes from the first whistle , this wonderful Borussia Dortmund side simply tore Liverpool apart , with two goals from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - it was a time for doubts but Klopp delivered inspiration . Liverpool needed three goals , leaving Klopp to invoke the spirit of Istanbul and the Champions League Final won from 3-0 down at half-time against AC Milan in 2005 , saying : &quot; Even if it is not likely it is possible , so we should try . &quot; And yet this was a mountain Liverpool had to try to climb twice , Divock Origi opened the door but Marco Reus shut it again to leave three goals needed in 33 minutes . It was time for believers , time for that notion Klopp talked about within minutes of walking into Anfield to be acted upon . And it was as Liverpool completed a turnaround that will become a touch@@ stone for the Klopp era with goals from Philippe Coutinho , Mamadou Sakho and the late drama from Lovren . Borussia Dortmund possessed class in abundance and that opening phase was jaw@@ -@@ dropping - but Liverpool simply broke them by sheer force of will and a refusal to give up . It takes us back to more words from Klopp . After Liverpool lost 2-1 to Crystal Palace at Anfield in November he was taken aback at supporters leaving early , saying it made him feel alone and adding : &quot; We decide when it &apos;s over . &quot; This was a phrase that could have been stamped on the fore@@ heads of Liverpool &apos;s players on Thursday - a symbol of the Klopp approach that will be at the heart of everything they do . If anyone entered Anfield as a doub@@ ter they will have been a confirmed and committed believer by the time they left . This night had a special feel even in the hours before kick-off as Anfield was splashed in colour , the yellow and black flags of Borussia Dortmund facing off against the red and white of Liverpool on The K@@ op . Before the teams emerged , Anfield was seren@@ aded by arguably the longest version of &quot; You &apos;ll Never Walk Alone &quot; ever heard at the stadium , Gerry Marsden &apos;s voice turned off and Liverpool &apos;s supporters taking over , the old anthem returning several times after a brief silence . A minute &apos;s silence to commemorate the 27th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 supporters died was perfectly observed , Anfield a ca@@ ul@@ dron of emotions . It was Liverpool who looked the more nervous side in the opening stages , cut to pieces by high-@@ class opponents who were not intimidated by the searing atmosphere . S@@ lowly , after a brief and shocked lull caused by a 2-0 deficit , the sound came back to deafening volume and Borussia were un@@ ner@@ ved to the point where their resolve was broken . Klopp was a man possessed on the touchline , waving his arms to demand greater encouragement for his players , pointing at his mouth while facing the fans to demand even more noise . It ended up providing a soundtrack to a momentous night . Tuchel said : &quot; When Liverpool equalised you noticed the change . There was belief in the stadium and a feeling it was meant to be . Both sets of fans were fantastic and that was one of the best atmos@@ pheres ever at a football match . &quot; Klopp added : &quot; It was brilliant , outstanding , emotional , everything . I will not forget it because it was special . I know this is a place for big football moments . We didn &apos;t start these stories but it is now our responsibility to try and write some more nice stories . &quot; There was certainly a new , unlikely chapter written at Anfield last night . In the after@@ glow of such sporting brilliance , there was little time for analysis of the nuts and bolts of Liverpool &apos;s performance . It was a time to simply reflect on the wonder of what we had witnessed . And yet , when there is time for reflection , it will reveal much of what is good - and still bad - about Liverpool . Divock Origi &apos;s goal , his fourth in his past three games , was a piece of composure that confirmed his growing stature and that qualities that persuaded Klopp to pick the 20-year-old ahead of Daniel Sturridge .

S-344	The president-elect has said Mrs Trump and Barron will move to Washington &quot; very soon , after he &apos;s finished with school , &quot; but has not put an actual date on the move . But transition spokesman Jason Miller &apos;s insistence that the Tru@@ mps were &quot; energised and excited about their new role serving the country &quot; and it was simply concern about changing schools in the middle of the year did little to quell criticisms on social media . &quot; First Family resid@@ es in White House as a symbol of our country to us and and the world , &quot; wrote one Twitter user , Pamela Ben@@ bow . &quot; Melania Trump &apos;s decision is appalling . &quot; Others joked it was Mrs Trump &apos;s taste in inter@@ iors which had prompted the decision , while some began speculating about what the move said about the Tru@@ mps &apos; marriage . However , the strength of feeling is somewhat unsurprising . There are only two other First Ladies in the history of the United States who have not made the White House their home during their husbands &apos; years as commander-in-chief : Martha Washington , because it had yet to be built , and Anna Harrison , because her husband died before she could take up residence . But Mrs Trump &apos;s decision has its supporters . &quot; Good , this is what most responsible parents do with a child Barron &apos;s age , &quot; one Twitter user noted . However , it is not out of character for Mrs Trump , who has repeatedly stressed that Barron , 10 , is her focus - staying at home during the campaign to care for him in Trump Towers . But they are far from the only mother and child to move into the White House . So how have families coped before ? William S@@ eale , a White House Historical Association historian and author of The President &apos;s House , said President Gro@@ ver Cleveland &apos;s wife , Frances Fol@@ som Cleveland , only lived in the White House during social season . The president bought a house during his first term , where Mrs Cleveland spent most of her time . The first lady referred to the first home as &quot; Oak View &quot; but it was more commonly known as &quot; Red Top &quot; because of its red roof . But the young bride , who was age 21 when she married the 49-year-old president , was the only first lady to be married in the White House . &quot; The concern of children staying back to finish school - that &apos;s more typical than not , &quot; Mr S@@ eale said . &quot; It seems not very unusual to me that she would want the child to finish this year of school . I don &apos;t find it very surprising . &quot; Mr S@@ eale noted that the children of President John Tyler , who became president after William Henry Harrison &apos;s death , were not immediately moved to the White House . James Madison &apos;s wife , Dol@@ ley Madison , also sent her son from her first marriage , Payne Todd , away to school . There have been two sets of school age children living in the White House in the past three decades : Chelsea Clinton , who was 12 at the time , and M@@ alia and Sasha Obama , who were 10 and seven respectively . They also had to move across the country when their fathers became president - but all three lived at 16@@ 00 Pennsylvania Avenue from the day of the inauguration . In fact , the Obam@@ as avoided the problem of the girls having to change school mid-term by moving to Washington early , allowing them to start a new school a few weeks before Dad was inaugurated in January 2009 . Read more : Why Obama may not go quietly Mrs Trump has indicated Barron will be her top priority , with everything else coming second . Reading between the lines , it suggests she will not be taking on the full-time role predecessors like Mrs Obama have . Officially , the role of the first lady is only ceremonial - she is supposed to be the White House &apos;s host@@ ess , organising and attending functions with or without their spouses . In more recent times , they have also sought out causes to support and promote . Mrs Obama has used her time backing a number of initiatives and projects , including Let Girls L@@ earn , that aims to help girls around the world go to school and stay in school . The first lady occupies a very public role , according to Mr S@@ eale . &quot; It gives a kind of personal side to the White House . It might even be considered vital to the public &apos;s perception of the president , &quot; he said . &quot; &#91; The president &#93; is an administrator and a he is a symbol and I think the first lady &apos;s role is very important to that symbol part . &quot; Lou Henry Ho@@ over , wife to President Herbert Ho@@ over , was the first president &apos;s wife to really take on an active public role , Mr S@@ eale said . Her immediate successor , Eleanor Roosevelt , also served as a more visible first lady in her husband &apos;s administration . One notable first lady who was reluctant to step into the public role was Nancy Reagan , according to Mr S@@ eale . Mrs Reagan , who had a big influence on her husband &apos;s presidency and would later become known for her anti-@@ drug campaign , was at first only focused on being a supportive wife . &quot; Her big interest in the world was her husband , &quot; Mr S@@ eale said , adding that she was a very private person . As to what Melania &apos;s priorities will be there is only one hint

S-323	For many people with severe disabilities , their families and carers , this is a reality they are faced with every time they leave the house . In some cases it can leave them feeling isolated and unable to enjoy the simplest of everyday activities that we take for granted just because they haven &apos;t got a suitable area to spend a penny . Ordin@@ ary accessible toilets may be the answer for many independent wheelchair users - but what about those who need two carers to help them or need a ho@@ ist to help them transfer on to a bench to change rather than a toilet ? &quot; Rec@@ om@@ m@@ end@@ ations are in place to support installing Changing Places toilets with enhanced facilities when designing larger buildings such as shopping centres , cinemas and leisure facilities - but campaigners are calling for these to be made compulsory . Lorna F@@ ill@@ ingham , mother of six-year-old Emil@@ y-@@ May , is concerned about the lack of truly accessible toilet facilities in town centres and has started a petition to campaign for changes in building regulations to make Changing Places guidelines compulsory &quot; It &apos;s like playing Russian rou@@ lette , &quot; Lorna says . &quot; Knowing I might have to change her on the dirty floors of standard accessible toilets that just aren &apos;t suitable if there is not a Changing Places nearby when we go out as a family is so stressful . &quot; My daughter is only six so she doesn &apos;t have any knowledge of what she is going to be put through , but I know and the thought of that makes me feel so guilty . &quot; Lorna has also submitted written evidence to the Women and Equalities parliamentary committee who are currently gathering evidence about how accessible the built environment is for disabled people . There are currently 8@@ 93 Changing Places toilets in the UK but what exactly are they ? They are different from standard disabled toilets as they have extra features and more space to help meet the needs of people who use them . Mike Le@@ Sur@@ f , Changing Places Development Officer at M@@ enc@@ ap says : &quot; There are potentially over a quarter of a million people who need a Changing Places toilet - because behind the standard accessible toilet door , people &apos;s needs are not being met . &quot; Alison Beevers describes the psychological effect on the whole family of not having an appropriate place for a change as her son Freddie gets older and their options for outings are slowly fl@@ ushed away . &quot; Imagine having to get down on your hands and knees and laying down on a dirty floor or squ@@ ashing yourself into the back of your car just because there isn &apos;t a bench and ho@@ ist in the toilet , &quot; she says . &quot; You just begin to get this sense of feeling like you &apos;re last in the line to be considered . &quot; It &apos;s soul-@@ destroying and you don &apos;t feel like a valued member of society at all . &quot; But it is not all doom and gloom and Alison gets by with a little help from her friends . She said : &quot; Freddie went to a party and one of my friends converted a room into a &apos; pop-up &apos; changing places , and brought stuff from home to kit it out - it was amazing &quot; Alison even tweeted from the party : &quot; Friends for life are those who organise parties in the village hall and provide a &apos; pop up &apos; # chang@@ ing@@ place so ALL can go ! &quot; Bethan Fol@@ en and her daughter Low@@ ri also enjoy their &quot; girls &apos; days out &quot; now there are more convenient and fully accessible places to change nearby . She said : &quot; Low@@ ri &apos;s favourite thing to do is to go to the Millennium Stadium &#91; now known as the Principality Stadium &#93; in Cardiff and watch Wales play rugby . She is a massive fan . Even before the stadium installed its Changing Places toilet , says Bethan , &quot; There were some nearby in the centre of Cardiff and it made things so much easier whenever we needed to change Low@@ ri &quot; Changing Places specifications have been included in the Building Standards guidelines ( BS 8@@ 300 : 2009 ) since 2009 as a recommendation rather than a compulsory requirement . Archit@@ ect V@@ ail@@ a Morrison explains why this creates a problem . &quot; By making it compulsory to have a Changing Places toilet in larger complex@@ es then you will give people clarity over what is expected as there is none at the moment , &quot; she says . &quot; As a designer you tend to focus on what you have to do in line with compulsory legislation and recommendations can be ignored because of this . &quot; For businesses , especially those in already existing buildings , logistical and financial barriers to installing these toilets can sometimes block plans . At 12 square metres ( 3m x 4m ) Changing Places are considerably larger than the standard accessible toilet ( 1,@@ 5m x 2.2m ) . Because of this campaigners are focusing their efforts on making it compulsory for newly built larger complex@@ es such as shopping centres , cinemas and sports stadiums in the building regulations . Arsenal Football Club , who were the first side in the Premier League to install a Changing Places toilet , have seen a very positive reaction not just from fans but from the general public too . Alun Francis , Disability Lia@@ ison Officer at the club , said : &quot; There were challenges and despite already having 38 wheelchair accessible toilets we were constrained by the original building design as it existed before the recommendations came in , so we had to adapt . &quot; But working with the people behind the Changing Places group was such a

S-494	Jamie Vardy &apos;s crisp finish from a lightning break gave Leicester the lead on 18 minutes - but he was then sent off after getting a second yellow card for diving when he tangled with Angelo Ogbonna early in the second half . Referee Jonathan Moss made himself even more unpopular when he awarded West Ham a penalty with six minutes left . There had been pushing and pulling in both penalty areas but he decided to punish Wes Morgan for pulling back Winston Reid at a corner . Analysis : MO@@ T@@ D2 pundits on referee &apos;s &apos; mind-@@ bo@@ ggling inconsistencies &apos; Substitute Andy Carroll slotted home to end Leicester &apos;s run of 5@@ 74 minutes without conceding a league goal and Aaron Cresswell looked to have opened the door to the Foxes &apos; title rivals Spurs with a stunning left-footed finish two minutes later . As the game went into injury time , Moss produced another controversial decision when he pointed to the spot once more after Carroll made the mer@@ est contact with Jeff Schlupp . West Ham clearly felt Moss had even@@ ed things up after earlier decisions in their favour , but Ulloa was not concerned as he took the chance to secure what might yet be a vital point - although Leicester will be without Vardy for next weekend &apos;s home game with Swansea . Relive the action from the King Power Stadium Leicester &apos;s fans celebrated at the end before turning their anger on referee Moss - although it was his very questionable decision that allowed them to earn that point at the end . Psych@@ ologically , this point could be vital because a loss might just have produced a few doubts and given Spurs just a little more wig@@ gle room going into their game at Stoke on Monday . It means Leicester &apos;s last Premier League defeat is still that last-minute loss at Arsenal on Valentine &apos;s Day and their spirits will be lifted by the manner in which they earned a point when it seemed certain they would end up empty-handed . Referee Moss was surrounded by players of both sides and escorted from the field by stewards to je@@ ering from the home fans at the final whistle . Moss &apos;s eventful second half began after 56 minutes when he penalised Vardy for simulation as he tumbled theat@@ r@@ ically under a challenge from Ogbonna . Having already given Vardy a yellow card , he felt obliged to give a second . Vardy made the most of the contact and ran the risk of punishment . And he has been accused of doing this before this season . Opinion was split but plenty felt Moss was right . For West Ham &apos;s penalty , there was undoubtedly pulling and pushing between Morgan and Winston Reid - so again Moss had justification . The difficulty , the inconsistency , is that similar behaviour had been going on in both penalty areas all afternoon without punishment - so why did Moss decide this was the time to penalise it ? Too often , these decisions seem arbitrary , as was demonstrated when Ogbonna dragged Huth to the floor even more un@@ ceremon@@ iously a few minutes later and no foul was given . Finally , in injury time and with an atmosphere of chaos engulfing the game , Moss pointed to the spot for the slightest touch from Carroll on Schlupp . It was incredibly harsh and the Hammers clearly felt Moss had punished them to make up for earlier decisions given against Leicester . It is a tough job - as the abuse directed the referee &apos;s way at the end proved . Not as much as there might have been had Ulloa not scored at the end , but they can apply pressure and move to within five points of Leicester if they win at Stoke . Leicester at least have the point in the bag but Mauricio Pochettino and his players will just feel the door is aj@@ ar , even if they know time and games are running out . Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri : &quot; It was a very tough match . We were lucky at the beginning when they touched both posts . After that we scored a great goal and we had an opportunity to finish the match at the beginning of the second half . Media playback is not supported on this device &quot; After then sending off it changed our match . &quot; I never spoke about the decision of the referee . Two yellow cards , that &apos;s it . &quot; Our performance 11 v 11 and 10 v 11 was fantastic . &quot; West Ham manager Slaven Bilic : &quot; It was a good game of football . We showed determination , character and quality . We turned the game around . We were dangerous , and after sending off we totally dominated the game . Media playback is not supported on this device &quot; After our second goal I thought we had done enough to win the game , maybe we could have coped with added time better in terms of keeping the ball but they took the risk . &quot; It was extremely hard for referee , but I mean that was no penalty at all . &quot; Leicester - minus the suspended Vardy - are at home to Swansea next Sunday .

S-388	Let &apos;s not forget the traditional argument with your other half about whose job it was to buy all the batteries for the children &apos;s new toys - which are currently a source of tension because nobody can turn them on . Am I right ? If that sounds all too familiar and you fancy keeping the whole thing a bit more spiritual this year without giving up your gadgets , here are five ways to enjoy Christmas online : Every@@ day Church Online , which launched in the UK in September , runs virtual services every Sunday for a net-@@ based congregation from around the world . Everyone &apos;s invited to log on and chat while a recorded sermon is streamed . So far , people from 61 different countries have logged on , according to online pastor Darren Parker . &quot; There are lots of reasons why people can &apos;t get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them , &quot; he says . &quot; The chat room is like the foyer of a church . &quot; Virtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included : Its first Christmas theme is Star Wars , the subject of three festive ser@@ mons . &quot; We found some real truths &#91; in the franchise &#93; which compare to Christmas , &quot; says Mr Parker . &quot; The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens . Our ser@@ mons are called The Hope Awakens - it &apos;s about awak@@ ening hope for humanity . &quot; The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church &apos;s website . Guardians of An@@ cor@@ a is a recently launched , free-to-@@ play fantasy game available on Android , iPhone and Kin@@ dle platforms . It &apos;s developed by the same people behind the young people &apos;s group the Sc@@ rip@@ ture Union . The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Cl@@ ut@@ ter@@ ham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release . &quot; An@@ cor@@ a is a weird , wonderful , amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians , &quot; he says . &quot; The problem with An@@ cor@@ a is that the light has been stolen from that world , so there is darkness around . &quot; It &apos;s the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible ... and those stories help to light up the world . &quot; You get the idea . Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bi@@ ble-@@ themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus . There are lots of very charming n@@ ativity videos out there but it &apos;s not easy to rack up the hits . German marketing company Vir@@ al@@ .@@ de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of N@@ ativity , which has so far been viewed almost six million times . There are no actors , no animals , and not even a stable . The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates , tweets , Google searches and Four@@ square check-@@ ins . Highlights include one &quot; Joseph Carpenter &quot; buying a cow and a donkey on Far@@ m@@ ville before uploading a baby picture , which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card . The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas St@@ arts with a Baby &apos;s Gig@@ gle , which features a modern-day couple sitting in a tren@@ dy living room with their baby , only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable . So far , it has been viewed about 250,000 times . &quot; It &apos;s pretty good - we &apos;re not John Lewis , we &apos;re a group of Christians with a very small budget , &quot; explains Frances Goodwin , who chairs the network . &quot; The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago . &quot; However , according to a report in the Daily Mail , the charity &apos;s attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being &quot; too religious . &quot; After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million book@@ lets telling Old Test@@ ament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga , the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-@@ book form - so far , only in the English language . The book containing its version of the n@@ ativity is called the Manga Mes@@ siah . It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees . &quot; We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much , &quot; says founder Roald L@@ idal . &quot; One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan , &quot; adds Mr L@@ idal , who lived in the country for 45 years . &quot; There is a Manga for every age and every type of person . It seemed very difficult to pro@@ claim the message of the Bible without using Manga . &quot; As if you needed the excuse . But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook , Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities , especially at this time of year . &quot; I don &apos;t see that much these days of trying to share the Gos@@ pel in 140 characters , &quot; says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier . &quot; The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in , get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a

S-95	As Ron Jones , from Newport , prepares to mark Holocaust Memorial Day on Friday with a service at the city &apos;s cathedral , he says that amongst all the terrible memories , there will also be a few which will make him smile . He was captured in 1943 fighting in the Middle East , and after nine months in Italy , was transferred to forced labour camp E@@ 7@@ 15 , part of the Auschwitz complex . There he spent 12 hours a day , six days a week , working with hazardous chemicals in the IG Far@@ ben works , but on Sundays they were permitted to play football . &quot; I think the Germans thought that letting us play football was a quick and easy way of keeping us quiet , &quot; he said . &quot; The Red Cross would bring us food parcels , and when they heard about our football , they managed to get us strips for four teams : England , Wales , Scotland and Ireland . I was always the Wales goalkeeper . &quot; It kept us sane , it was a bit of normality , but it sounds wrong somehow to say I &apos;ve got fond memories of playing football , considering what was going on just over the fence . &quot; He says as well as keeping up spirits , football played a major role in his survival , and that of many of his fellow prisoners , when they were forced on one of the series of extremely long marches west@@ wards from Po@@ W camps during the final stages of the conflict . Whilst many of Mr Jones &apos;s friends died on the march , he believes it is no coincidence that those who had been involved in the Auschwitz football league fared better . &quot; You could say the football we &apos;d played saved our lives . The football lads were fitter , yes , but more than that , they belonged to a group which kept each other going on the march . &quot; E@@ 7@@ 15 was located close to Auschwitz III , Mon@@ owitz , which held mainly Polish resistance fighters , political dissidents , homosexuals and some captured Soviet troops . Whilst this was not officially a death camp , Mr Jones says it did not take long for him to realise that the inmates at Mon@@ owitz were far from safe . &quot; In the nights you could hear shots coming from Mon@@ owitz , &quot; he said . &quot; Not bursts like you had when you were fighting , but deliberate , regular every few seconds ; like they had a system going . &quot; We didn &apos;t know who they were or why they &apos;d been killed , and we couldn &apos;t help but be terrified that we &apos;d be next . &quot; But when the British Po@@ W@@ s were allowed out to play football , they would be taken to fields next to Auschwitz II , Birken@@ au , where killing was on an altogether more industrial scale . &quot; The first Sunday we went to the playing fields , we saw these people - well walking skeletons they were really - digging trenches , &quot; he said . &quot; We asked , &apos; Who are those poor so@@ ds ? &apos; and the German guards shout &apos; Jud@@ en &apos; , Jews , as if it had been a stupid question . &quot; We could only play in the summer , because everything was covered in snow through the winter . But when it was hot , this awful sten@@ ch would w@@ aft across from the crem@@ atori@@ ums . &quot; Your imag@@ inations pretty much filled in the gaps for you , but we &apos;d carry on playing football . &quot; Sc@@ oring a goal , making a save or arguing about an offside was the only way you could stop yourself from cracking up . &quot; Mr Jones says he has spent a great deal of time since the war wondering about how much his German guards had known and cared about what was going on inside Birken@@ au . &quot; You have to remember that our guards weren &apos;t SS like in Birken@@ au ; they were con@@ scripted squ@@ ad@@ dies like us , &quot; he said . &quot; Dozens of them would come and cheer our football matches and have a laugh with us , and if you got them on their own , you could tell that they were ordinary , decent blo@@ kes . &quot; But if you asked them about Birken@@ au they &apos;d get angry and scared . &apos; We didn &apos;t need to know &apos; , &apos; they didn &apos;t know &apos; , &apos; it was nothing &apos; , and even if it was , then &apos; it wasn &apos;t their fault , they weren &apos;t SS &apos; . &quot; &quot; I had nightmares about Auschwitz for years after the war , but I bet mine were nothing compared with what those Germans must have gone through . &quot; Some would say they deserve it , but most likely they couldn &apos;t have done any more about it than we could have ourselves . &quot; As the Red Army closed in , on 21 January , 1945 German guards burst into Mr Jones &apos;s hut in the middle of the night , and ordered him to leave immediately with whatever he could carry .

S-343	Ed Snowden , a 29-year-old former technical worker for the CIA , has since revealed himself to be the source of the leaks in an interview with the Guardian news website . US director of national intelligence James Clapper described the leaks as &quot; extremely damaging &quot; to national security , but Mr Snowden said he had acted because he found the extent of US surveillance &quot; horrifying . &quot; What could the US government see ? According to the documents revealed by Ed Snowden , the US National Security Agency ( NSA ) has access on a massive scale to individual chat logs , stored data , voice traffic , file transfers and social networking data of individuals . The US government confirmed it did request millions of phone records from US company Verizon , which included call duration , location and the phone numbers of both parties on individual calls . How much do the sp@@ ooks know ? Why every call matters What can you learn from phone records ? According to the documents , Prism also enabled &quot; back@@ door &quot; access to the servers of nine major technology companies including Microsoft , Yahoo , Google , Facebook , Pal@@ Talk , A@@ O@@ L , Skype , YouTube and Apple . These servers would process and store a vast amount of information , including private posts on social media , web chats and internet searches . All the companies named have denied their involvement , and it is unknown how Prism actually works . National Security Agency ( NSA ) Director Keith Alexander said that the eaves@@ dropping operations have helped keep Americans secure - yet cannot provide details . &quot; If we tell the terrorists every way that we &apos;re going to track them , they will get through and Americans will die , &quot; he said Some experts question its true powers , with digital forensics professor Peter Sommer telling the BBC the access may be more akin to a &quot; cat@@ fla@@ p &quot; than a &quot; back@@ door . &quot; &quot; The sp@@ ooks may be allowed to use these firms &apos; servers but only in respect of a named target , &quot; he said . &quot; Or they may get a court order and the firm will provide them with material on a hard-@@ drive or similar . &quot; What about data-@@ protection laws ? Different countries have different laws regarding data protection , but these tend to aim to regulate what data companies can hold about their customers , what they can do with it and how long they can keep it for - rather than government activity . Most individual company privacy policies will include a clause suggesting they will share information if legally obliged - and include careful wording about other monitoring . Facebook &apos;s privacy policy , for example , states : &quot; We use the information &#91; uploaded by users &#93; to prevent potentially illegal activities . &quot; Are we all being watched ? The ways in which individual governments monitor citizen activity is notoriously secretive in the interests of national security , and officials generally argue that preventing terrorism over-@@ rides protecting privacy . &quot; You can &apos;t have 100 % security and also then have 100 % privacy and zero inconvenience , &quot; said US President Barack Obama , defending US surveillance tactics . Senator Di@@ anne Fe@@ instein , chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said that phone records were only accessed by the NSA in cases where there was reason to suspect an individual was connected with al-Qaeda or Iran . Speaking to the BBC UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said that &quot; law abiding citizens &quot; in Britain would &quot; never be aware of all the things ... agencies are doing to stop your identity being stolen or to stop a terrorist blowing you up . &quot; Does it make a difference which country you live in ? U@@ ser data ( such as emails and social media activity ) is often not stored in the same country as the users themselves - Facebook for example has a clause in its privacy policy saying that all users must consent to their data being &quot; transferred to and stored in &quot; the US . The US Patriot Act of 2001 gave American authorities new powers over European data stored in this way . This method of storage is part of cloud computing , in which both storage and processing is carried out away from the individual &apos;s own PC . &quot; Most cloud providers , and certainly the market leaders , fall within the US jurisdiction either because they are US companies or conduct systematic business in the US , &quot; Axel Arn@@ b@@ ak , a researcher at the University of Amsterdam &apos;s Institute for Information Law , told CBS News last year after conducting a study into cloud computing , higher education and the act . &quot; In particular , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amend@@ ments ( FI@@ SA ) Act makes it easy for US authorities to circumvent local government institutions and mandate direct and easy access to cloud data belonging to non-@@ Americans living outside the US , with little or no transparency obligations for such practices - not even the number of actual requests . &quot; Are other governments involved ? UK Foreign Secretary William Hague has so far refused to confirm or deny whether British government surveillance department GCHQ has had access to Prism . It is not known whether other governments around the world have been either aware of or involved in the use of Prism , which is reported to have been established in 2007 . In a statement , the EU Justice Commission said it was &quot; concerned &quot; about the consequences of Prism for EU citizens and was &quot; seeking more details &quot; from the US authorities . &quot; Where the rights of an EU citizen in a Member State are concerned , it is for a national judge to determine whether data

S-226	It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points . This , from a team that has won 182 grands prix , at a win rate of 23.@@ 18 % , 12 drivers &apos; world championships , and eight constructors &apos; titles . And which still , despite its dire current results , has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them , Fernando Alonso , arguably the best on the grid . Listen : Dennis on Alonso , loyalty &amp; mentality The slump started in 2013 , when McLaren lost its way on chassis design , but still had the best engine . Now , the team seem to have got their mo@@ jo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-@@ unit . This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history . In 1988 , they swept a season like no-one has since , even Mercedes . With the two best drivers in the world in their cars , Ayrton Senna and Alain Pr@@ ost , they won 15 of the 16 races . They dominated the next four years , before spending several years in the dol@@ drums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success , with M@@ ika Hak@@ kin@@ en and Mercedes engines in 1998-@@ 99 . Amaz@@ ingly , the team &apos;s last constructors &apos; title was in the first of those two years of victories with the &apos; flying Finn &apos; . They should have won it again , in 2007 , when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship , a single point behind the winner , Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari . But although the team scored more points than any other , McLaren were kicked out of the constructors &apos; championship that year - and fined $ 100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of re@@ ams of Ferrari technical information . There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed &apos; li@@ e-@@ gate &apos; - after Hamilton and sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix . This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton , and the sack for Ryan . Until 2012 , when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them , the victories kept coming , but other than Hamilton &apos;s in 2008 , the titles dried up - and now the wins have , too . In many ways , their current predicament is nothing surprising . McLaren &apos;s F1 history has , like those of many long-term participants , been a cycle of triumph and decline . Their first decade , following the team &apos;s establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force , a process that continued despite the founder &apos;s death in a testing crash in 1970 . Their maiden title came in 1974 , with the Brazilian Emerson Fit@@ ti@@ pal@@ di . Another followed two years later , courtesy of James Hunt in his now-@@ famous battle with Ferrari &apos;s Niki Lau@@ da . But then the team began to slip backwards , left behind by the technology of the time . Rather like now . So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marl@@ bor@@ o engineered a coup , bringing on board Ron Dennis , first as co-@@ team boss . He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since , in one role or another . Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 198@@ 4-5 , followed by the Honda era , then a partnership with Mercedes , before stepping back in 2009 , only to take back control after the team &apos;s disastrous 2013 season . So far , his return has not had its intended effect . But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline ? Or are the good times around the corner again ? Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return . It is McLaren , he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team &apos;s golden anniversary , who will break Mercedes &apos; h@@ eg@@ em@@ ony in F1 , and become the next team after the German giants to win the title . This , after all , is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007 . The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there ; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go , but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end . Dennis and his li@@ euten@@ ants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide , that the car is among the very best this year , and that next year Honda - who last year re-@@ entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is , too . They can see the progress , they say , and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver &quot; championships , pl@@ ural , &quot; as Dennis puts it . But right now , belief is all they have . And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport &apos;s greatest ever drivers , but also

Kaz@@ im@@ -@@ Richards is perhaps even more of a gamble , not only because of his off-field antics but also for a lack of career goals , and steady Erik Sviatchenko is maybe a safer bet to prove worthy of the £ 1.5m Celtic paid Midtjylland for the Denmark defender . Celtic might need to squeeze every last pound of value out of their new arrivals to thwart a sustained Aberdeen title challenge that appears to have surprised even those inside Pittodrie . The Dan@@ dies &apos; dead@@ line-@@ day signing of Simon Church on loan from MK Dons means they have a striker hungry for goals to ensure his place in Wales &apos; Euro 2016 finals squad . However , the Dons may live to regret their bun@@ gled attempt to sign Greg Tansey from Inverness Caledonian Thistle in events that left them minus the additional cover in central midfield manager Derek McInnes thought necessary . While they brought in two replacements , the recall by Liverpool of promising goalkeeper Danny Ward could also prove costly in the long run . Third-@@ top Hearts made the biggest profit during January as they arranged a deal that should mean they pocket more than £ 1m for the sale of Osman S@@ ow to Hen@@ an Ji@@ anye , who also bought Ryan McGowan from Dundee United , as the Chinese Super League begins to flex its financial muscle . The Edinburgh club have replaced the Swede with A@@ bi@@ ola Dau@@ da , a Nigerian striker on loan from Vitesse who has an even more impressive scoring record . Elsewhere , there was the usual influx and exchange of jour@@ ne@@ ymen pros , with Dundee United failing to make the kind of exciting acquisitions that will transform their fans &apos; hopes into expectation that they can bridge the gaping points gap at the bottom of the table .
